<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I<br />
STUART HARLEY: REALIST</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;<i>if a word could save me</i>,
<i>and that word were not the Truth</i>, <i>nay</i>, <i>if it did
but swerve a hair&rsquo;s-breadth from the Truth</i>, <i>I would
not say it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Longfellow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Stuart Harley</span>, despite his
authorship of many novels, still considered himself a
realist.&nbsp; He affected to say that he did not write his
books; that he merely transcribed them from life as he saw it,
and he insisted always that he saw life as it was.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>&ldquo;The mission of the novelist, my dear
Professor,&rdquo; he had once been heard to say at his club,
&ldquo;is not to amuse merely; his work is that of an historian,
and he should be quite as careful to write truthfully as is the
historian.&nbsp; How is the future to know what manner of lives
we nineteenth century people have lived unless our novelists tell
the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly the historians will tell them,&rdquo; observed
the Professor of Mathematics.&nbsp; &ldquo;Historians sometimes
do tell us interesting things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very true; but
then what historian ever let you into the secret of the every-day
life of the people of whom he writes?&nbsp; What historian ever
so vitalized Louis the Fourteenth as Dumas has vitalized <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>him?&nbsp;
Truly, in reading mere history I have seemed to be reading of lay
figures, not of men; but when the novelist has taken hold
properly&mdash;ah, then we get the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; objected the Professor, &ldquo;the
novelist is never to create a great character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The humorist or the mere romancer may, but as for the
novelist with a true ideal of his mission in life he would better
leave creation to nature.&nbsp; It is blasphemy for a purely
mortal being to pretend that he can create a more interesting
character or set of characters than the Almighty has already
provided for the use of himself and his brothers in literature;
that he can involve these creations in a more dramatic series of
events than it has occurred to an all-wise <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Providence to
put into the lives of His creatures; that, by the exercise of
that misleading faculty which the writer styles his imagination,
he can portray phases of life which shall prove of more absorbing
interest or of greater moral value to his readers than those to
be met with in the every-day life of man as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Professor, with a dexterous jab
of his cue at the pool-balls&mdash;&ldquo;then, in your
estimation, an author is a thing to be led about by the nose by
the beings he selects for use in his books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put it in a rather homely fashion,&rdquo; returned
Harley; &ldquo;but, on the whole, that is about the size of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all a man needs, then, to be an <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>author is an
eye and a type-writing machine?&rdquo; asked the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a regiment of detectives,&rdquo; drawled Dr. Kelly,
the young surgeon, &ldquo;to follow his characters
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley sighed.&nbsp; Surely these men were unsympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t expect you to grasp the idea
exactly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t explain it to
you, because you&rsquo;d become irreverent if I tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Kelly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
on and explain it to us&mdash;I&rsquo;m bored, and want to be
amused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Harley went on and tried to explain how the true realist
must be an inspired sort of person, who can rise above purely
physical limitations; whose eye shall be able to pierce the most
impenetrable of veils; to whom nothing in the <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>way of
obtaining information as to the doings of such specimens of
mankind as he has selected for his pages is an insurmountable
obstacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your author, then, is to be a mixture of a New York
newspaper reporter and the Recording Angel?&rdquo; suggested
Kelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d become irreverent,&rdquo; said
Harley; &ldquo;nevertheless, even in your irreverence, you have
expressed the idea.&nbsp; The writer must be omniscient as far as
the characters of his stories are concerned&mdash;he must have an
eye which shall see all that they do, a mind sufficiently
analytical to discern what their motives are, and the courage to
put it all down truthfully, neither adding nor subtracting,
coloring only where color is needed to make the moral lesson he
is <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>trying to
teach stand out the more vividly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, you&rsquo;d have him become a
photographer,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More truly a soulscape-painter,&rdquo; retorted Harley,
with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried the Doctor, dropping his cue with
a loud clatter to the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Soulscape!&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s a man talking about not creating, and then throws
out an invention like soulscape!&nbsp; Harley, you ought to write
a dictionary.&nbsp; With a word like soulscape to start with, it
would sweep the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley laughed.&nbsp; He was a good-natured man, and he was
strong enough in his convictions not to weaken for the mere
reason that somebody else had ridiculed them.&nbsp; In fact,
everybody else might have ridiculed them, and Harley <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>would still
have stood true, once he was convinced that he was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on sawing people&rsquo;s legs off, Billy,&rdquo;
he said, good-naturedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a thing you
know about; and as for the Professor, he can go on showing you
and the rest of mankind just why the shortest distance between
two points is in a straight line.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take your
collective and separate words for anything on the subject of
surgery or mathematics, but when it comes to my work I
wouldn&rsquo;t bank on your theories if they were endorsed by the
Rothschilds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never write a decent book in his life if he
clings to that theory,&rdquo; said Kelly, after Harley had
departed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s precious little in the way
of the dramatic nowadays in the lives of people one cares to read
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Nevertheless, Harley had written interesting books, books
which had brought him reputation, and what is termed genteel
poverty&mdash;that is to say, his fame was great, considering his
age, and his compensation was just large enough to make life
painful to him.&nbsp; His income enabled him to live well enough
to make a good appearance among, and share somewhat at their
expense in the life of, others of far greater means; but it was
too small to bring him many of the things which, while not
absolutely necessities, could not well be termed luxuries,
considering his tastes and his temperament.&nbsp; A little more
was all he needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could afford to write only when I feel like
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how happy I should be!&nbsp; But these
orders&mdash;they <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>make me a driver of men, and not their
historian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, Harley was in that unfortunate, and at the same time
happy, position where he had many orders for the product of his
pen, and such financial necessities that he could not afford to
decline one of them.</p>
<p>And it was this very situation which made his rebellious
heroine of whom I have essayed to write so sore a trial to the
struggling young author.</p>
<p>It was early in May, 1895, that Harley had received a note
from Messrs. Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick, the publishers,
asking for a story from his pen for their popular &ldquo;Blue and
Silver Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The success of your <i>Tiffin-Talk</i>,&rdquo; they
wrote, &ldquo;has been such that we are <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>prepared to
offer you our highest terms for a short story of 30,000 words, or
thereabouts, to be published in our &lsquo;Blue and Silver
Series.&rsquo;&nbsp; We should like to have it a love-story, if
possible; but whatever it is, it must be characteristic, and
ready for publication in November.&nbsp; We shall need to have
the manuscript by September 1st at the latest.&nbsp; If you can
let us have the first few chapters in August, we can send them at
once to Mr. Chromely, whom it is our intention to have illustrate
the story, provided he can be got to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter closed with a few formalities of an unimportant and
stereotyped nature, and Harley immediately called at the office
of Messrs.&nbsp; Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick, where, after
learning that <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>their best terms were no more unsatisfactory than
publishers&rsquo; best terms generally are, he accepted the
commission.</p>
<p>And then, returning to his apartment, he went into what Kelly
called one of his trances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes into one of his trances,&rdquo; Kelly had said,
&ldquo;hoists himself up to his little elevation, and peeps into
the private life of <i>hoi polloi</i> until he strikes something
worth putting down and the result he calls literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the people buy it, and read it, and call for
more,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly because they love notoriety,&rdquo; said
Kelly, &ldquo;and they think if they call for more often enough,
he will finally peep in at their key-holes and write them
up.&nbsp; If he ever puts me into one <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of his books I&rsquo;ll waylay him at
night and amputate his writing-hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Professor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I asked him once why he didn&rsquo;t, and he said
you&rsquo;d never do in one of his books, because you don&rsquo;t
belong to real life at all.&nbsp; He thinks you are some new
experiment of an enterprising Providence, and he doesn&rsquo;t
want to use you until he sees how you turn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could put me down as I go,&rdquo; suggested the
Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I told him so, but he said he had no desire to write a lot
of burlesque sketches containing no coherent idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he said that, did he?&rdquo; observed the Doctor,
with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well&mdash;wait till Stuart Harley
comes to me for a prescription.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get even with
him.&nbsp; <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>I&rsquo;ll give him a pill, and he&rsquo;ll
disappear&mdash;for ten days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was as Kelly said or not, that Harley went into a
trance and poked his nose into the private life of the people he
wrote about, it was a fact that while meditating upon the
possible output of his pen our author was as deaf to his
surroundings as though he had departed into another world, and it
rarely happened that his mind emerged from that condition without
bringing along with it something of value to him in his work.</p>
<p>So it was upon this May morning.&nbsp; For an hour or two
Harley lay quiescent, apparently gazing out of his flat window
over the uninspiring chimney-pots of the City of New York, at the
equally uninspiring Long Island station on the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>far side of
the East River.&nbsp; It was well for him that his eye was able
to see, and yet not see: forgetfulness of those smoking
chimney-pots, the red-zincked roofs, the flapping under-clothing
of the poorer than he, hung out to dry on the tenement tops, was
essential to the construction of such a story as Messrs. Herring,
Beemer, &amp; Chadwick had in mind; and Harley successfully
forgot them, and, coming back to consciousness, brought with him
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> of his story&mdash;and, taken
as a whole, they were an interesting lot.&nbsp; The hero was like
most of those gentlemen who live their little lives in the novels
of the day, only Harley had modified his accomplishments in
certain directions.&nbsp; Robert Osborne&mdash;such was his
name&mdash;was not the sort of man to do impossible <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>things for
his heroine.&nbsp; He was not reckless.&nbsp; He was not a
D&rsquo;Artagnan lifted from the time of Louis the Fourteenth to
the dull, prosaic days of President Faure.&nbsp; He was not even
a Frenchman, but an essentially American American, who desires to
know, before he does anything, why he does it, and what are his
chances of success.&nbsp; I am not sure that if he had happened
to see her struggling in the ocean he would have jumped <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>in to rescue
the young woman to whom his hand was plighted&mdash;I do not
speak of his heart, for I am not Harley, and I do not know
whether or not Harley intended that Osborne should be afflicted
with so inconvenient an organ&mdash;I am not sure, I say, that if
he had seen his best-beloved struggling in the ocean Osborne
would have jumped in to rescue her without first stopping to
remove such of his garments as might impede his progress back to
land again.&nbsp; In short, he was not one of those impetuous
heroes that we read about so often and see so seldom; but, taken
altogether, he was sufficiently attractive to please the American
girl who might be expected to read Harley&rsquo;s book; for that
was one of the stipulations of Messrs. Herring, Beemer, &amp;
Chadwick when they made their verbal agreement with Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it go with the girls, Harley,&rdquo; Mr. Chadwick
had said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Men haven&rsquo;t time to read anything
but the newspapers in this country.&nbsp; Hit the girls, and your
fortune is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley didn&rsquo;t exactly see how his fortune was going to
be made on the <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>best terms of Messrs. Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick,
even if he hit the girls with all the force of a battering-ram,
but he promised to keep the idea in mind, and remained in his
trance a trifle longer than might otherwise have been necessary,
endeavoring to select the unquestionably correct hero for his
story, and Osborne was the result.&nbsp; Osborne was moderately
witty.&nbsp; His repartee smacked somewhat of the refined comic
paper&mdash;that is to say, it was smart and cynical, and not
always suited to the picture; but it wasn&rsquo;t vulgar or dull,
and his personal appearance was calculated to arouse the
liveliest interest.&nbsp; He was clean shaven and clean
cut.&nbsp; He looked more like a modern ideal of infallible
genius than Byron, and had probably played football and the banjo
in college&mdash;<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Harley did not go back that far with him&mdash;all of
which, it must be admitted, was pretty well calculated to assure
the fulfilment of Harley&rsquo;s promise that the man should
please the American girl.&nbsp; Of course the story was provided
with a villain also, but he was a villain of a mild type.&nbsp;
Mild villany was an essential part of Harley&rsquo;s literary
creed, and this particular person was not conceived in
heresy.&nbsp; His name was to have been Horace Balderstone, and
with him Harley intended to introduce a lively satire on the
employment, by certain contemporary writers, of the supernatural
to produce dramatic effects.&nbsp; Balderstone was of course to
be the rival of Osborne.&nbsp; In this respect Harley was
commonplace; to his mind the villain always had to be the rival
of the hero, <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>just as in opera the tenor is always virtuous at heart
if not otherwise, and the baritone a scoundrel, which in real
life is not an invariable rule by any means.&nbsp; Indeed, there
have been many instances in real life where the villain and the
hero have been on excellent terms, and to the great benefit of
the hero too.&nbsp; But in this case Balderstone was to follow in
the rut, and become the rival of Osborne for the hand of
Marguerite Andrews&mdash;the heroine.&nbsp; Balderstone was to
write a book, which for a time should so fascinate Miss Andrews
that she would be blind to the desirability of Osborne as a
husband-elect; a book full of the weird and thrilling, dealing
with theosophy and spiritualism, and all other
&ldquo;Tommyrotisms,&rdquo; as Harley called them, all of <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>which, of
course, was to be the making and the undoing of Balderstone; for
equally of course, in the end, he would become crazed by the use
of opium&mdash;the inevitable end of writers of that stamp.&nbsp;
Osborne would rescue Marguerite from his fatal influence, and the
last chapter would end with Marguerite lying pale and wan upon
her sick-bed, recovering from the mental prostration which the
influence over hers of a mind like Balderstone&rsquo;s was sure
to produce, holding Osborne&rsquo;s hand in hers, and
&ldquo;smiling a sweet recognition at the lover to whose virtues
she had so long been blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Osborne would murmur,
&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; and the book would close with a
&ldquo;first kiss,&rdquo; followed closely by six or eight pages
of advertisements of other publications of Messrs. Herring, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Beemer, &amp;
Chadwick.&nbsp; I mention the latter to show how thoroughly
realistic Harley was.&nbsp; He thought out his books so truly and
so fully before he sat down to write them that he seemed to see
each written, printed, made and bound before him, a concrete
thing from cover to cover.</p>
<p>Besides Osborne and Balderstone and Miss Andrews&mdash;of whom
I shall at this time not speak at length, since the balance of
this little narrative is to be devoted to the setting forth of
her peculiarities and charms&mdash;there were a number of minor
characters, not so necessary to the story perhaps as they might
have been, but interesting enough in their way, and very well
calculated to provide the material needed for the filling out of
the required number of pages.&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Furthermore, they completed the
picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put in three vivid figures, and
leave the reader to imagine that the rest of the world has been
wiped out of existence,&rdquo; said Harley, as he talked it over
with me.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is not art.&nbsp; There should be
three types of character in every book&mdash;the positive, the
average, and the negative.&nbsp; In that way you grade your story
off into the rest of the world, and your reader feels that while
he may never have met the positive characters, he has met the
average or the negative, or both, and is therefore by one of
these links connected with the others, and that gives him a
personal interest in the story; and it&rsquo;s the reader&rsquo;s
personal interest that the writer is after.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>So Miss
Andrews was provided with a very conventional aunt&mdash;the kind
of woman you meet with everywhere; most frequently in church
squabbles and hotel parlors, however.&nbsp; Mrs. Corwin was this
lady&rsquo;s name, and she was to enact the r&ocirc;le of
chaperon to Miss Andrews.&nbsp; With Mrs. Corwin, by force of
circumstances, came a pair of twin children, like those in the
<i>Heavenly Twins</i>, only more real, and not so Sarah Grandiose
in their manners and wit.</p>
<p>These persons Harley booked for the steamship <i>New York</i>,
sailing from New York City for Southampton on the third day of
July, 1895.&nbsp; The action was to open at that time, and
Marguerite Andrews was to meet Horace Balderstone on that vessel
on the evening of the second day out, with which incident the <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>interest of
Harley&rsquo;s story was to begin.&nbsp; But Harley had counted
without his heroine.&nbsp; The rest of his cast were safely
stowed away on ship-board and ready for action at the appointed
hour, but the heroine <i>missed the steamer by three minutes</i>,
<i>and it was all Harley&rsquo;s own fault</i>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> extraordinary failure of Miss
Andrews, cast for a star r&ocirc;le in Stuart Harley&rsquo;s tale
of <i>Love and Villany</i>, to appear upon the stage selected by
the author for her d&eacute;b&ucirc;t, must be explained.&nbsp;
As I have already stated at the close of the preceding chapter,
it was entirely Harley&rsquo;s own fault.&nbsp; He had studied
Miss Andrews too superficially to grasp thoroughly the more
refined subtleties of her nature, and he found out, at a <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>moment when
it was too late to correct his error, that she was not a woman to
be slighted in respect to the conventionalities of polite life,
however trifling to a man of Harley&rsquo;s stamp these might
seem to be.&nbsp; She was a stickler for form; and when she was
summoned to go on board of an ocean steamship there to take part
in a romance for the mere aggrandizement of a young author, she
intended that he should not ignore the proprieties, even if in a
sense the proprieties to which she referred did antedate the
period at which his story was to open.&nbsp; She was willing to
appear, but it seemed to her that Stuart Harley ought to see to
it that she was escorted to the scene of action with the ceremony
due to one of her position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he take me for?&rdquo; she <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>asked of Mrs.
Corwin, indignantly, on the eve of her departure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am
I a mere marionette, to obey his slightest behest, and at a
moment&rsquo;s notice?&nbsp; Am I to dance when Stuart Harley
pulls the string?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p28b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Am I a mere marionette?"
title=

src="images/p28s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, my dear Marguerite,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Corwin, soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he thought that, he would not
have selected you for his story.&nbsp; I think you ought to feel
highly complimented that Mr. Harley should choose you for one of
his books, and for such a conspicuous part, too.&nbsp; Look at
me; do I complain?&nbsp; Am I holding out for the
proprieties?&nbsp; And yet what is my situation?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
simply dragged in by the hair; and my poor children, instead of
having a nice, noisy Fourth of July at the sea-shore, must needs
be put upon a great floating <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>caravansary, to suffer seasickness
and the other discomforts of ocean travel, so as to introduce a
little juvenile fun into this great work of Mr.
Harley&rsquo;s&mdash;and yet I bow my head meekly and go.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Because I feel that, inconspicuous though I shall be,
nevertheless I am highly honored that Mr. Harley should select me
from among many for the uses of his gifted pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are prepared, then,&rdquo; retorted Marguerite,
&ldquo;to place yourself unreservedly in Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
hands?&nbsp; Shall you flirt with the captain if he thinks your
doing so will add to the humorous or dramatic interest of his
story?&nbsp; Will you permit your children to make impertinent
remarks to every one aboard ship; to pick up sailors&rsquo; slang
and use it at the dining-table&mdash;in short, to make <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>themselves
obnoxiously clever at all times, in order that Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
critics may say that his book fairly scintillates with wit, and
gives gratifying evidence that &lsquo;the rising young
author&rsquo; has made a deep and careful analysis of the
juvenile heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harley is too much of a gentleman, Marguerite, to
place me and my children in a false or ridiculous light,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Corwin, severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;And even if he were
not a gentleman, he is too true a realist to make me do anything
which in the nature of things I should not do&mdash;which
disposes of your entirely uncalled-for remark about the captain
and myself.&nbsp; As for the children, Tommie would not repeat
sailors&rsquo; lingo at the table under any circumstances, and
Jennie will not make herself <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>obnoxiously clever at any time,
because she has been brought up too carefully to fail to respect
her elders.&nbsp; Both she and Tommie understand themselves
thoroughly; and when Mr. Harley understands them, which he cannot
fail to do after a short acquaintance, he will draw them as they
are; and if previous to his complete understanding of their
peculiarities he introduces into his story something foreign to
their natures and obnoxious to me, their mother, I have no doubt
he will correct his error when he comes to read the proofs of his
story and sees his mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have great confidence in Stuart Harley,&rdquo;
retorted Miss Andrews, gazing out of the window with a pensive
cast of countenance.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Corwin,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a man, yes,&rdquo; returned Marguerite.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As an author, however, I think he is open to
criticism.&nbsp; He is not always true to the real.&nbsp; Look at
Lord Barncastle, in his study of English manners!&nbsp;
Barncastle, as he drew him, was nothing but a New York society
man with a title, living in England.&nbsp; That is to say, he
talked like an American, thought like one&mdash;there was no
point of difference between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should there be?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Corwin.&nbsp; &ldquo;If a New York society man is generally a
weak imitation of an English peer&mdash;and no one has ever
denied that such is the case&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t an English
peer be represented as a sort of intensified New York society
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Miss Andrews, ignoring Mrs.
Corwin&rsquo;s point, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to be presented
too really to the reading public, especially on board a
ship.&nbsp; I never yet knew a woman who looked well the second
day out, and if I were to be presented as I always am the second
day out, I should die of mortification.&nbsp; My hair goes out of
curl, my face is the color of an unripe peach, and if I do go up
on deck it is because I am so thoroughly miserable that I do not
care who sees me or what the world thinks of me.&nbsp; I think it
is very inconsiderate of Mr. Harley to open his story on an ocean
steamer; and, what is more, I don&rsquo;t like the American
line.&nbsp; Too many Americans of the brass-band type travel on
it.&nbsp; Stuart Harley said so himself in his last book of
foreign travel; <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>but he sends me out on it just the same, and expects me
to be satisfied.&nbsp; Perhaps he thinks I like that sort of
American.&nbsp; If he does, he&rsquo;s got more imagination than
he ever showed in his books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must get to the other side in some way,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Corwin.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is at Venice that the trouble with
Balderstone is to come, and that Osborne topples him over into
the Grand Canal, and rescues you from his baleful
influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Marguerite, with a scornful shrug of
her shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Robert Osborne!&nbsp; A likely sort
of person to rescue me from anything!&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t
have nerve enough to rescue me from a grasshopper if he were
armed to the teeth.&nbsp; Furthermore, I shall not go to Venice
in August.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bad enough in <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>April&mdash;damp and hot&mdash;the home of
malaria&mdash;an asylum for artistic temperaments; and
insecty.&nbsp; No, my dear aunt, even if I overlook everything
else to please Mr. Harley, he&rsquo;ll have to modify the
Venetian part of that story, for I am determined that no pen of
his shall force me into Italy at this season.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t go there to please Shakespeare, much less Stuart
Harley.&nbsp; Let the affair come off at Interlaken, if it is to
come off at all, which I doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no Grand Canal at Interlaken,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Corwin, sagely; for she had been an omnivorous reader of Baedeker
since she had learned the part she was to play in Harley&rsquo;s
book, and was therefore well up in geography.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but there&rsquo;s the Jungfrau.&nbsp; Osborne can
push Balderstone down the <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>side of an Alp and kill him,&rdquo;
returned Miss Andrews, viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Marguerite!&nbsp; How can you talk so?&nbsp; Mr.
Harley doesn&rsquo;t wish to have Balderstone killed,&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Corwin, aghast.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Osborne killed
Balderstone he&rsquo;d be a murderer, and they&rsquo;d execute
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is exactly what I want,&rdquo; said Miss Andrews,
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he lives, it pleases the omnipotent Mr.
Harley that I shall marry him, and I positively&mdash;Well, just
you wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for some minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose you will decline to go abroad
altogether?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Corwin after a while; &ldquo;and
Mr. Harley will be forced to get some one else; and I&mdash;I
shall be deprived of a pleasant tour&mdash;because I&rsquo;m only
to be <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>one
of the party because I&rsquo;m your aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Corwin&rsquo;s lip quivered a little as she spoke.&nbsp;
She had anticipated much pleasure from her trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shall not decline to go,&rdquo; Miss Andrews
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I expect to go, but it is entirely on your
account.&nbsp; I must say, however, that Stuart Harley will find
out, to his sorrow, that I am not a doll, to be worked with a
string.&nbsp; I shall give him a scare at the outset which will
show him that I know the rights of a heroine, and that he must
respect them.&nbsp; For instance, he cannot ignore my
comfort.&nbsp; Do you suppose that because his story is to open
with my beautiful self on board that ship, I&rsquo;m to be there
without his making any effort to get me there?&nbsp; Not I!&nbsp;
You and the children <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and Osborne and Balderstone may go
down any way you please.&nbsp; You may go on the elevated
railroad or on foot.&nbsp; You may go on the horse-cars, or you
may go on the luggage-van.&nbsp; It is immaterial to me what you
do; but when it comes to myself, Stuart Harley must provide a
carriage, or I miss the boat.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to involve
you in this.&nbsp; You want to go, and are willing to go in his
way, which simply means turning up at the right moment, with no
trouble to him.&nbsp; From your point of view it is all
right.&nbsp; You are anxious to go abroad, and are grateful to
Mr. Harley for letting you go.&nbsp; For me, however, he must do
differently.&nbsp; I have no particular desire to leave America,
and if I go at all it is as a favor to him, and he must act
accordingly.&nbsp; It is a case of <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>carriage or no heroine.&nbsp; If
I&rsquo;m left behind, you and the rest can go along without
me.&nbsp; I shall do very well, and it will be Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
own fault.&nbsp; It may hurt his story somewhat, but that is no
concern of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the reason why he doesn&rsquo;t send a
carriage is that that part of your life doesn&rsquo;t appear in
his story,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Corwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t affect the point that he ought to
send one,&rdquo; said Marguerite.&nbsp; &ldquo;He needn&rsquo;t
write up the episode of the ride to the pier unless he wants to,
but the fact remains that it&rsquo;s his duty to see me safely on
board from my home, and that he shall do, or I fail him at the
moment he needs me.&nbsp; If he is selfish enough to overlook the
matter, he must suffer the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>All of
which, I think, was very reasonable.&nbsp; No heroine likes to
feel that she is called into being merely to provide copy for the
person who is narrating her story; and to be impressed with the
idea that the moment she is off the stage she must shift entirely
for herself is too humiliating to be compatible with true
heroism.</p>
<p>Now it so happened that in his meditations upon that opening
chapter the scene of which was to be placed on board of the
<i>New York</i>, Stuart realized that his story of Miss
Andrews&rsquo;s character had indeed been too superficial.&nbsp;
He found that out at the moment he sat down to describe her
arrival at the pier, as it would be in all likelihood.&nbsp; What
would she say the moment she&mdash;the moment she what?&mdash;the
moment <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>she
&ldquo;emerged from the perilous stream of vehicles which crowd
West Street from morning until night,&rdquo; or the moment
&ldquo;she stepped out of the cab as it drew up at the foot of
the gangway&rdquo;?&nbsp; That was the point.&nbsp; How would she
arrive&mdash;on foot or in a cab?&nbsp; Which way would she come,
and at what time must she start from home?&nbsp; Should she come
alone, or should Mrs. Corwin and the twins come with
her?&mdash;or would a woman of her stamp not be likely to have an
intimate friend to accompany her to the steamer?&nbsp; Stuart was
a rapid thinker, and as he pondered over these problems it did
not take him long to reach the conclusion that a cab was
necessary for Miss Andrews; and that Mrs. Corwin and the twins,
with Osborne and Balderstone, might get aboard in their <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>own
way.&nbsp; He also decided that it would be an excellent plan to
have Marguerite&rsquo;s old school friend Mrs. Willard accompany
her to the steamer.&nbsp; By an equally rapid bit of thought he
concluded that if the cab started from the Andrews apartment at
Fifty-ninth Street and Central Park at 9.30 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, the trip to the pier could easily
be made in an hour, which would be in ample time, since the
sailing hour of the <i>New York</i> was eleven.&nbsp;
Unfortunately Harley, in his hurry, forgot two or three incidents
of departures generally, especially departures of women, which he
should not have overlooked.&nbsp; It was careless of him to
forget that a woman about to travel abroad wants to make herself
as stunning as she possibly can on the day of departure, so that
the impression she <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>will make at the start shall be strong enough to carry
her through the dowdy stage which comes, as Marguerite had
intimated, on the second and third days at sea; and to expect a
woman like Marguerite Andrews, who really had no responsibilities
to call her up at an early hour, to be ready at 9.30 sharp, was a
fatal error, unless he provided his cab with an unusually fast
horse, or a pair of horses, both of which Harley neglected to
do.&nbsp; Miss Andrews was twenty minutes late at starting the
first time, and just a half-hour behind schedule time when,
having rushed back to her rooms for her gloves, which in the
excitement of the moment she had forgotten, she started finally
for the ship.&nbsp; Even then all would have been well had the
unfortunate author not over<a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>looked one other vital point.&nbsp;
Instead of sending the cab straight down Fifth Avenue, to
Broadway, to Barclay Street, he sent it down Sixth, and thence
through Greenwich Village, emerging at West Street at its
junction with Christopher, and then the inevitable happened.</p>
<p><i>The cab was blocked</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea it was so far,&rdquo; said Marguerite,
looking out of the cab window at the crowded and dirty
thoroughfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good mile farther yet,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Willard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall have just that much more of your
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; said Marguerite, with a short
laugh, as the cab came suddenly to a halt&mdash;&ldquo;it looks
to me as if you were likely to have more than that of it; for we
are in an apparently inextricable, <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>immovable mixture of trucks,
horse-cars, and incompetent policemen, and nothing short of a
miracle will get us a mile farther along in twenty
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe you are right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Willard,
looking at her watch anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will you do if
you miss the steamer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escape a horrid fate,&rdquo; laughed Marguerite,
gayly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Harley&mdash;why, it will upset his whole
story,&rdquo; said Mrs. Willard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And save his reputation,&rdquo; said Marguerite.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been real, that story,&rdquo; she
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the first place, Balderstone
couldn&rsquo;t write a story that would fascinate me; he could
never acquire a baleful influence over me; and, finally, I never
should marry <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Robert Osborne under any circumstances.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
not at all the style of man I admire.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willing to
go along and let Mr. Harley try to work it out his way, but he
will give it up as a bad idea before long&mdash;if I catch the
steamer; and if I don&rsquo;t, then he&rsquo;ll have to modify
the story.&nbsp; That modified, I&rsquo;m willing to be his
heroine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your aunt and the twins&mdash;they must be aboard
by this time.&nbsp; They will be worried to death about
you,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Willard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a few moments&mdash;but <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Aunt Emma wanted to go, and she and
the rest of them will have a good time, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt,&rdquo; replied Miss Andrews, calmly; and here Stuart
Harley&rsquo;s heroine actually chuckled.&nbsp; &ldquo;And maybe
Mr. Harley can make a match between Aunt Emma and Osborne, which
will suit the publishers and please the American girl,&rdquo; she
said, gleefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I almost hope we do miss
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And miss it they did, as I have already told you, by three
minutes.&nbsp; As the cab entered the broad pier, the great
steamer moved slowly but surely out into the stream, and Mrs.
Willard and Mr. Harley&rsquo;s heroine were just in time to see
Mrs. Corwin wildly waving her parasol at the captain on the
bridge, beseeching him in agonized tones to go back just for a
moment, while two separate and distinct twins, one male and one
female, peered over the rail, weeping bitterly.&nbsp;
Incidentally mention may be made of two young men, Balderstone
and Osborne, who sat chatting gayly together in the
smoking-room.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;Well, Osborne,&rdquo; said one, lighting his
cigar, &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fact is,
Balderstone, I&rsquo;m glad of it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s too snippy
for me, and I&rsquo;m afraid I should have quarrelled with you
about her in a half-hearted, unconvincing manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;d have been the same,&rdquo;
rejoined Balderstone; &ldquo;for, between us, there&rsquo;s a
pretty little brunette from Chicago up on deck, and Marguerite
Andrews would have got little attention from me while she was
about, unless Harley violently outraged my feelings and his own
convictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the <i>New York</i> sailed out to sea, and Marguerite
Andrews watched her from the pier until she had faded from
view.</p>
<p>As for Stuart Harley, the author, he <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>sat in his
study, wringing his hands and cursing his carelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to modify the whole story now,&rdquo;
he said, impatiently, &ldquo;since it is out of my power to bring
the <i>New York</i> back into port, with my hero, villain,
chaperon, and twins; but whenever or wherever the new story may
be laid, Marguerite Andrews shall be the heroine&mdash;she
interests me.&nbsp; Meantime let Mrs. Willard chaperon
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And closing his manuscript book with a bang, Harley lit a
cigarette, put on his hat, and went to the club.</p>
<h2><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>III<br

THE RECONSTRUCTION BEGINS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Then gently scan your brother

class="smcap">Burns</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, a few days later, Harley came
to the reconstruction of his story, he began to appreciate the
fact that what had seemed at first to be his misfortune was, on
the whole, a matter for congratulation; and as he thought over
the people he had sent to sea, he came to rejoice that Marguerite
was not one of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Osborne wasn&rsquo;t her sort, after all,&rdquo; <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>he mused to
himself that night over his coffee.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t
much mind.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I banked too much on his good
looks, and too little upon what I might call her independence;
for of all the heroines I ever had, she is the most sufficient
unto herself.&nbsp; Had she gone along I&rsquo;m half afraid I
couldn&rsquo;t have got rid of Balderstone so easily either, for
he&rsquo;s a determined devil as I see him; and his intellectual
qualities were so vastly superior to those of Osborne that by
mere contrast they would most certainly have appealed to her
strongly.&nbsp; The baleful influence might have affected her
seriously, and Osborne was never the man to overcome it, and
strict realism would have forced her into an undesirable
marriage.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;m glad it turned out the way it did;
she&rsquo;s too good for <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>either of them.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t have done the tale as I intended without a certain
amount of compulsion, which would never have worked out
well.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d have been miserable with Osborne for a
husband anyhow, even if he did succeed in outwitting
Balderstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Harley went into a trance for a moment.&nbsp; From this
he emerged almost immediately with a laugh.&nbsp; The travellers
on the sea had come to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mrs. Corwin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
awfully upset.&nbsp; I shall have to give her some
diversion.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see, what shall it be?&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a widow, young and fascinating.&nbsp;
H&rsquo;m&mdash;not a bad foundation for a romance.&nbsp; There
must be a man on the ship who&rsquo;d like her; but, hang it all!
there are those twins.&nbsp; Not much romance for her with those
twins along, <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>unless the man&rsquo;s a fool; and she&rsquo;s too fine
a woman for a fool.&nbsp; Men don&rsquo;t fall in love with whole
families that way.&nbsp; Now if they had only been left on the
pier with Miss Andrews, it would have worked up well.&nbsp; Mrs.
Corwin could have fascinated some fellow-traveller, won his
heart, accepted him at Southampton, and told him about the twins
afterwards.&nbsp; As a test of his affection that would be a
strong situation; but with the twins along, making the remarks
they are likely to make, and all that&mdash;no, there is no hope
for Mrs. Corwin, except in a juvenile story&mdash;something like
&lsquo;Two Twins in a Boat, not to Mention the Widow,&rsquo; or
something of that sort.&nbsp; Poor woman!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let
her rest in peace, for the present.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll enjoy her
trip, anyhow; and as <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>for Osborne and Balderstone,
I&rsquo;ll let them fight it out for that dark-eyed little woman
from Chicago I saw on board, and when the best man wins
I&rsquo;ll put the whole thing into a short story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then began a new quest for characters to go with Marguerite
Andrews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have a chaperon, to begin with,&rdquo; thought
Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is indispensable.&nbsp; Herring,
Beemer, &amp; Chadwick regard themselves as conservators of
public morals, in their &lsquo;Blue and Silver Series,&rsquo; so
a girl unmarried and without a chaperon would never do for this
book.&nbsp; If they were to publish it in their &lsquo;Yellow
Prism Series&rsquo; I could fling all such considerations to the
winds, for there they cater to stronger palates, palates
cultivated by French literary cooks, and morals need not be <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>considered,
provided the story is well told and likely to sell; but this is
for the other series, and a chaperon is a <i>sine qua
non</i>.&nbsp; Marguerite doesn&rsquo;t need one half as much as
the girls in the &lsquo;Yellow Prism&rsquo; books, but
she&rsquo;s got to have one just the same, or the American girl
will not read about her: and who is better than Dorothy Willard,
who has charge of her now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley slapped his knee with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fortunate I&rsquo;d provided her!&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my start already, and without
having to think very hard over it either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trance began again, and lasted several hours, during which
time Kelly and the Professor stole softly into Harley&rsquo;s
rooms, and, perceiving his condition, respected it.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s either asleep or imagining,&rdquo;
said the Professor, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; returned the
Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call it&mdash;realizing.&nbsp; Whatever it
is he&rsquo;s up to, we mustn&rsquo;t interfere.&nbsp; There
isn&rsquo;t any use waking him anyhow.&nbsp; I know where he
keeps his cigars.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s sit down and have a
smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the intruders did, hoping that sooner or later their host
would observe their presence; but Harley lay in blissful
unconsciousness of their coming, and they finally grew weary of
waiting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p56b.jpg">
<img alt=
"He went into one of his trances"
title=
"He went into one of his trances"
src="images/p56s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be at work on a ten-volume novel,&rdquo; said
the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that they departed.&nbsp; Night came on, and with it
darkness, but Harley never moved.&nbsp; The fact was he was going
through an examination of the <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>human race to find a man good enough
for Marguerite Andrews, and it speaks volumes for the interest
she had suddenly inspired in his breast that it took him so long
to find what he wanted.</p>
<p>Along about nine o&rsquo;clock he gave a deep sigh and
returned to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; he said, wearily,
rubbing his forehead, which began to ache a trifle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll model him after the Professor.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
a good fellow, moderately good-looking, has position, and
certainly knows something, as professors go.&nbsp; I doubt if he
is imposing enough for the American girl generally, but
he&rsquo;s the best I can get in the time at my
disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Professor was unconsciously slated for the office of
hero; Mrs. Willard <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>was cast for chaperon, and the Doctor, in spite of
Harley&rsquo;s previous resolve not to use him, was to be
introduced for the comedy element.&nbsp; The villain selected was
the usual poverty-stricken foreigner with a title and a passion
for wealth, which a closer study of his heroine showed Harley
that Miss Andrews possessed; for on her way home from the pier
she took Mrs. Willard to the Amsterdam and treated her to a
luncheon which nothing short of a ten-dollar bill would pay for,
after which the two went shopping, replenishing Miss
Andrews&rsquo;s wardrobe&mdash;most of which lay snugly stored in
the hold of the <i>New York</i>, and momentarily getting farther
and farther away from its fair owner&mdash;in the course of which
tour Miss Andrews expended a sum which, had Harley <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>possessed it,
would have made it unnecessary for him to write the book he had
in mind at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good she&rsquo;s rich,&rdquo; sighed
Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will make it all the easier to have her
go to Newport and attract the Count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment that Harley spoke these words to himself Mrs.
Willard and Marguerite, accompanied by Mr. Willard, entered the
mansion of the latter on Fifth Avenue.&nbsp; They had spent the
afternoon and evening at the Andrews apartment, arranging for its
closing until the return of Mrs. Corwin.&nbsp; Marguerite
meanwhile was to be the guest of the Willards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next week we&rsquo;ll run up to Newport,&rdquo; said
Dorothy.&nbsp; &ldquo;The house is ready, and Bob is going for
his cruise.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Marguerite looked at her curiously for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you intend to go there all along?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course.&nbsp; Why do you ask?&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Willard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that very idea came into my mind at the
moment,&rdquo; replied Marguerite.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought this
afternoon I&rsquo;d run up to Riverdale and stay with the
Hallidays next week, when all of a sudden Newport came into my
mind, and it has been struggling there with Riverdale for two
hours&mdash;until I almost began to believe somebody was trying
to compel me to go to Newport.&nbsp; If it is your idea, and has
been all along, I&rsquo;ll go; but if Stuart Harley is trying to
get me down there for literary purposes, I simply shall not do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;You had better dismiss that idea from your mind
at once, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Willard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Harley never compels.&nbsp; No compulsion is the corner-stone of
his literary structure; free will is his creed: you may count on
that.&nbsp; If he means to make you his heroine still, it will be
at Newport if you are at Newport, at Riverdale if you happen to
be at Riverdale.&nbsp; Do come with me, even if he does impress
you as endeavoring to force you; for at Newport I shall be your
chaperon, and I should dearly love to be put in a book&mdash;with
you.&nbsp; Bob has asked Jack Perkins down, and Mrs. Howlett
writes me that Count Bonetti, of Naples, is there, and is a
really delightful fellow.&nbsp; We shall have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You simply confirm my fears,&rdquo; interrupted <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Marguerite.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are to be Harley&rsquo;s
chaperon, Professor Perkins is his hero, and Count Bonetti is the
villain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Marguerite, how you talk!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Willard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you exist merely in Stuart
Harley&rsquo;s brain?&nbsp; Do I?&nbsp; Are we none of us living
creatures to do as we will?&nbsp; Are we nothing more than
materials pigeon-holed for Mr. Harley&rsquo;s future use?&nbsp;
Has Count Bonetti crossed the ocean just to please Mr.
Harley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I believe,&rdquo; said Miss
Andrews, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t care much either way, as long
as I have independence of action.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go with you,
Dorothy; but if it turns out, as I fear, that we are expected to
act our parts in a Harley romance, that romance will receive <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>a shock from
which it will never recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you object so to Mr. Harley, anyhow?&nbsp; I
thought you liked his books,&rdquo; said Mrs. Willard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; some of them,&rdquo; Marguerite answered;
&ldquo;and I like him; but he does not understand me, and until
he does he shall not put me in his stories.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll rout
him at every point, until he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marguerite paused.&nbsp; Her face flushed.&nbsp; Tears came
into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until he what, dearest?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Willard,
sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Marguerite, with a
quiver in her voice, as she rose and left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy we&rsquo;d better go at once, Bob,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Willard to her husband, later on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marguerite is
quite upset <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>by the experiences of the day, and New York is fearfully
hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; returned Willard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jerrold sent word this afternoon that the boat will be
ready Friday, instead of Thursday of next week; so if
you&rsquo;ll pack up to-morrow we can board her Friday, and go up
the Sound by water instead of by rail.&nbsp; It will be
pleasanter for all hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was just what Harley wanted.&nbsp; The Willards were of
course not conscious of the fact, though Mrs. Willard&rsquo;s
sympathy with Marguerite led her to suspect that such was the
case; for that such was the case was what Marguerite feared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are being forced, Dorothy,&rdquo; she said, as she
stepped on the yacht two days later.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;Well, what if we are?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pleasanter
going this way than by rail, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Mrs. Willard
replied, with some impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we owe all this to
Stuart Harley, we ought to thank him for his kindness.&nbsp;
According to your theory he could have sent us up on a hot, dusty
train, and had a collision ready for us at New London, in order
to kill off a few undesirable characters and give his hero a
chance to distinguish himself.&nbsp; I think that even from your
own point of view Mr. Harley is behaving in a very considerate
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you think so,&rdquo; returned Marguerite,
spiritedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s different with you.&nbsp;
You are settled in life.&nbsp; Your husband is the man of your
choice; you are happy, with everything you want.&nbsp; You will
do nothing extraordinary <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>in the book.&nbsp; If you did do
something extraordinary you would cease to be a good chaperon,
and from that moment would be cast aside; but I&mdash;I am in a
different position altogether.&nbsp; I am a single woman,
unsettled as yet, for whom this author in his infinite wisdom
deems it necessary to provide a lover and husband; and in order
that his narrative of how I get this person he has
selected&mdash;without consulting my tastes&mdash;may interest a
lot of other girls, who are expected to buy and read his book, he
makes me the object of an intriguing fortune-hunter from
Italy.&nbsp; I am to believe he is a real nobleman, and all that;
and a stupid wiseacre from the York University, who can&rsquo;t
dance, and who thinks of nothing but his books and his club, is
to come in at the right moment <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and expose the Count, and all such
trash as that.&nbsp; I know at the outset how it all is to
be.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t deceive a sensible girl five minutes
with Count Bonetti, any more than that Balderstone man, who is
now making a useless trip across the Atlantic with my aunt and
her twins, could have exerted a &lsquo;baleful influence&rsquo;
over me with his diluted spiritualism.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not an
idiot, my dear Dorothy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a heroine, love,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Willard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;but I am the kind of heroine who would
stop a play five minutes after the curtain had risen on the first
act if the remaining four acts depended on her failing to see
something that was plain to the veriest dolt in the
audience,&rdquo; Marguerite replied, with spirit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nobody <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>shall ever write me up save as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;perhaps you are wrong this time.&nbsp;
Perhaps Mr. Harley isn&rsquo;t going to make a book of
you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Willard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Marguerite;
&ldquo;but he&rsquo;s trying it&mdash;I know that
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how, pray?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Willard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Marguerite, her frown vanishing and a
smile taking its place&mdash;&ldquo;that is for the present my
secret.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you some day, but not until I have
baffled Mr. Harley in his ill-advised purpose of marrying me off
to a man I don&rsquo;t want, and wouldn&rsquo;t have under any
circumstances.&nbsp; Even if I had caught the <i>New York</i> the
other day his plans would <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>have miscarried.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
never have married that Osborne man; I&rsquo;d have snubbed
Balderstone the moment he spoke to me; and if Stuart Harley had
got a book out of my trip to Europe at all, it would have been a
series of papers on some such topic as &lsquo;The Spinster
Abroad, or How to be Happy though Single.&rsquo;&nbsp; No more
shall I take the part he intends me to in this Newport romance,
unless he removes Count Bonetti from the scene entirely, and
provides me with a different style of hero from his Professor,
the original of whom, by-the-way, as I happen to know, is already
married and has two children.&nbsp; I went to school with his
wife, and I know just how much of a hero he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they went to Newport, and Harley&rsquo;s novel opened
swimmingly.&nbsp; <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>His description of the yacht was perfect; his narration
of the incidents of the embarkation could not be improved upon in
any way.&nbsp; They were absolutely true to the life.</p>
<p>But his account of what Marguerite Andrews said and did and
thought while on the Willards&rsquo; yacht was not realism at
all&mdash;it was imagination of the wildest kind, for she said,
did, and thought nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Harley did his best, but his heroine was obdurate, and the
poor fellow did not know that he was writing untruths, for he
verily believed that he heard and saw all that he attributed to
her exactly as he put it down.</p>
<p>So the story began well, and Harley for a time was quite
happy.&nbsp; At the end of a week, however, he had a fearful
set-back.&nbsp; <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Count Bonetti was ready to be presented to Marguerite
according to the plan, but there the schedule broke down.</p>
<p>Harley&rsquo;s heroine took a new and entirely unexpected
tack.</p>
<h2><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>IV<br
/>
A CHAPTER FROM HARLEY, WITH NOTES</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Good-bye</i>, <i>proud world</i>,
<i>I&rsquo;m going home</i>.<br />
<i>Thou art not my friend</i>, <i>and I&rsquo;m not
thine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Emerson</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">think</span> the reader will possibly
gain a better idea of what happened at the Howlett dance, at
which Count Bonetti was to have been presented to Miss Andrews,
if I forego the pleasure of writing this chapter myself, and
produce instead the chapter of Stuart Harley&rsquo;s ill-fated
book which was to have dealt with that most interesting
incident.&nbsp; Having relinquished all hope of ever getting that
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>particular
story into shape without a change of heroine, and being unwilling
to go to that extreme, Mr. Harley has very kindly placed his
manuscript at my disposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use it as you will, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he said,
when I asked him for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything
with it myself, and it is merely occupying space in my
pigeon-holes for which I can find better use.&nbsp; It may need a
certain amount of revision&mdash;in fact, it is sure to, for it
is unconscionably long, and, thanks to the persistent failure of
Miss Andrews to do as I thought she would, may frequently seem
incoherent.&nbsp; For your own sake revise it, for the readers of
your book won&rsquo;t believe that you are telling a true story
anyhow; they will say that you wrote this chapter and attributed
it to <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>me,
and you will find yourself held responsible for its
shortcomings.&nbsp; I have inserted a few notes here and there
which will give you an idea of what I suffered as I wrote on and
found her growing daily less and less tractable, with
occasionally an indication of the point of divergence between her
actual behavior and that which I expected of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To a fellow-workman in literary fields this chapter is of
pathetic interest, though it may not so appear to the reader who
knows little of the difficulties of authorship.&nbsp; I can
hardly read it myself without a feeling of most intense pity for
poor Harley.&nbsp; I can imagine the sleepless nights which
followed the shattering of his hopes as to what his story might
be by the recalcitrant attitude of the young woman he had honored
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>so highly
by selecting her for his heroine.&nbsp; I can almost feel the
bitter sense of disappointment, which must have burned to the
very depths of his soul, when he finally realized how completely
overturned were all his plans, and I cannot forego calling
attention to the constancy to his creed of Stuart Harley, in
sacrificing his opportunity rather than his principles, as shown
by his resolute determination not to force Miss Andrews to do his
bidding, even though it required merely the dipping of his pen
into the ink and the resolution to do so.</p>
<p>I cannot blame her, however.&nbsp; Granting to Harley the
right to a creed, Miss Andrews, too, it must be admitted, was
entitled to have views as to how she ought to behave under given
circumstances, <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>and if she found her notions running counter to his, it
was only proper that she should act according to the dictates of
her own heart, or mind, or whatever else it may be that a woman
reasons with, rather than according to his wishes.</p>
<p>As to all questions of this kind, however, as between the two,
the reader must judge, and one document in evidence is
Harley&rsquo;s chapter, which ran in this wise:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">A MEETING</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stop beating</i>, <i>heart</i>, <i>and in a moment
calm</i><br />
<i>The question answer&mdash;is this</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>my
fate</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Perkins&rsquo;s</span> &ldquo;Odes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the correspondents of the New York papers had surmised,
invitations for the Howlett ball were issued on the 12th.&nbsp;
It is not surprising that the correspondents <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>in this
instance should be guilty of that rare crime among society
reporters, accuracy, for their information was derived from a
perfectly reliable source, Mrs. Howlett&rsquo;s butler, in whose
hands the addressing of the envelopes had been placed&mdash;a man
of imposing presence, and of great value to the professional
snappers-up of unconsidered trifles of social gossip in the pay
of the Sunday newspapers, with many of whom he was on terms of
closest intimacy.&nbsp; Of course Mrs. Howlett was not aware that
her household contained a personage of great journalistic
importance, any more than her neighbor, Mrs. Floyd-Hopkins, was
aware that it was her maid who had furnished the <i>Weekly
Journal of Society</i> with the vivid account of the scandalous
behavior, at her last dinner, <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>of Major Pompoly, who had to be
forcibly ejected from the Floyd-Hopkins domicile by the husband
of Mrs. Jernigan Smith&mdash;a social morsel which attracted much
attention several years ago.&nbsp; Every effort was made to hush
that matter up, and the guests all swore eternal secrecy; but the
<i>Weekly Journal of Society</i> had it, and, strangely enough,
had it right, in its next issue; but the maid was never
suspected, even though she did appear to be possessed of more
ample means than usual for some time after.&nbsp; Mrs.
Floyd-Hopkins preferred to suspect one of her guests, and, on the
whole, was not sorry that the matter had got abroad, for
everybody talked about it, and through the episode her dinner
became one of the historic banquets of the season.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>The
Willards, who were by this time comfortably settled at &ldquo;The
Needles,&rdquo; their cottage on the cliff, it is hardly
necessary to state, were among those invited, and with their
cards was included one for Marguerite.&nbsp; Added to the card
was a personal note from Mrs. Howlett to Miss Andrews, expressing
the especial hope that she would not fail them, all of which was
very gratifying to the young girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; she cried, gleefully,
running into Mrs. Willard&rsquo;s &ldquo;den&rdquo; at the head
of the beautiful oaken stairs.</p>
<p>(<i>Note</i>.&mdash;At this point in Harley&rsquo;s manuscript
there is evidence of indecision on the author&rsquo;s part.&nbsp;
His heroine had begun to bother him a trifle.&nbsp; He had
written a half-dozen lines descriptive of <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Miss
Andrews&rsquo;s emotions at receiving a special note of
invitation, subsequently erasing them.&nbsp; The word
&ldquo;gleefully&rdquo; had been scratched out, and then restored
in place of &ldquo;scornfully,&rdquo; which had at first been
substituted for it.&nbsp; It was plain that Harley was not quite
certain as to how much a woman of Miss Andrews&rsquo;s type would
care for a special attention of this nature, even if she cared
for it at all.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the word chosen should
have been &ldquo;dubiously,&rdquo; and neither
&ldquo;gleefully&rdquo; nor &ldquo;scornfully&rdquo;; for the
real truth was that there was no reason why Mrs. Howlett should
so honor Marguerite, and the girl at once began to wonder if it
were not an extra precaution of Harley&rsquo;s to assure her
presence at the ball for the benefit of himself and his
publishers.&nbsp; <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>The author finally wrote it as I have given it above,
however, and Miss Andrews received her special invitation
&ldquo;gleefully&rdquo;&mdash;according to Harley.&nbsp; He
perceives her doubt, however, without comprehending it; for after
describing Mrs. Willard&rsquo;s reading of the note, he goes
on.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very nice of Mrs. Howlett,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Willard, handing Marguerite back her note.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
special honor, my dear, by which you should feel highly
flattered.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t often do things like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Marguerite.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am a perfect stranger to her, and that she should do it
at all strikes me as being most extraordinary.&nbsp; It
doesn&rsquo;t seem sincere, and I can&rsquo;t help thinking that
some extraneous circumstance <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>has been brought to bear upon her to
force her to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>Note</i>.&mdash;Stuart Harley has commented upon this as
follows: &ldquo;As I read this over I must admit that Miss
Andrews was right.&nbsp; Why I had Mrs. Howlett do such a thing I
don&rsquo;t know, unless it was that my own admiration for my
heroine led me to believe that some more than usual attention was
her due.&nbsp; In my own behalf I will say that I should in all
probability have eliminated or corrected this false note when I
came to the revision of my proofs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chapter then
proceeds.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we wear?&rdquo; mused Mrs. Willard, as
Marguerite folded Mrs. Howlett&rsquo;s note and replaced it in
its envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must positively decline to discuss <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>that
question.&nbsp; It is of no public interest,&rdquo; snapped
Marguerite, her face flushing angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;My clothing
is my own business, and no one&rsquo;s else.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
paused a moment, and then, in an apologetic tone, she added,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be perfectly willing to talk with you about it
generally, my dear Dorothy, but not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard looked at the girl in surprise.</p>
<p>(<i>Note</i>.&mdash;Stuart Harley has written this in the
margin: &ldquo;Here you have one of the situations which finally
compelled me to relinquish this story.&nbsp; You know yourself
how hard it is to make 30,000 words out of a slight situation,
and at the same time stick to probability.&nbsp; I had an idea,
in mapping out this chapter, that I could make three or four
interesting pages&mdash;interesting to the girls, mind <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>you&mdash;out
of a discussion of what they should wear at the Howlett
dance.&nbsp; It was a perfectly natural subject for discussion at
the time and under the circumstances.&nbsp; It would have been a
good thing in the book, too, for it might have conveyed a few
wholesome hints in the line of good taste in dress which would
have made my story of some value.&nbsp; Women are always writing
to the papers, asking, &lsquo;What shall I wear here?&rsquo; and
&lsquo;What shall I wear there?&rsquo;&nbsp; The ideas of two
women like Mrs. Willard and Marguerite Andrews would have been
certain to be interesting, elevating, and exceedingly useful to
such people, but the moment I attempted to involve them in that
discussion Miss Andrews declined utterly to speak, and I was cut
out of some six or seven hundred quite <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>important words.&nbsp; I had supposed
all women alike in that matter, but I find I was mistaken; one,
at least, won&rsquo;t discuss clothes&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t
wonder that Mrs. Willard looked up in surprise.&nbsp; I put that
in just to please myself, for of course the whole incident would
have had to be cut out when the manuscript went to the
type-setter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chapter takes a new lead here, as
follows:)</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard was punctiliously prompt in sending the
acceptances of herself and Mr. Willard to Mrs. Howlett, and at
the same time Marguerite&rsquo;s acceptance was despatched,
although she was at first disposed to send her regrets.&nbsp; She
was only moderately fond of those inconsequent pleasures which
make the life social.&nbsp; She was a good dancer, but a more
excellent talker, and she preferred <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>talking to dancing; but the inanity
of what are known as stair talks at dances oppressed her; nor did
she look forward with any degree of pleasure to what we might
term conservatory confidences, which in these luxurious days have
become so large a factor in terpsichorean diversions, for
Marguerite was of a practical nature.&nbsp; She had once chilled
the heart of a young poet by calling Venice malarious (Harley
little realized when he wrote this how he would have suffered had
he carried out his original intention and transplanted Marguerite
to the City of the Sea!), and a conservatory to her was a thing
for mid-day, and not for midnight.&nbsp; She was therefore not
particularly anxious to spend an evening&mdash;which began at an
aggravatingly late hour instead of at a <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>reasonable
time, thanks to a social custom which has its foundation in
nothing short of absolute insanity&mdash;in the pursuit of
nothing of greater value than dancing, stair talks, and
conservatory confidences; but Mrs. Willard soon persuaded her
that she ought to go, and go she did.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful night, that of the 22<i>d</i> of
July.&nbsp; Newport was at her best.&nbsp; The morning had been
oppressively warm, but along about three in the afternoon a
series of short and sharp electrical storms came, and as quickly
went, cooling the heated city, and freshening up the air until it
was as clear as crystal, and refreshing as a draught of cold
spring-water.</p>
<p>At the Howlett mansion on Bellevue Avenue all was in readiness
for the event.&nbsp; The caterer&rsquo;s wagons had arrived with
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>their
dainty contents, and had gone, and now the Hungarian band was
sending forth over the cool night air those beautiful and weird
waves of melody which entrance the most unwilling ear.&nbsp;
About the broad and spacious grounds festooned lights hung from
tree to tree; here and there little rose-scented bowers for
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> talks were set; from
within, streaming through the windows in regal beauty, came the
lights of the vast ballroom, the reception-rooms, and the
beautifully designed dining-hall&mdash;lately added by young
Morris Black, the architect, to Mrs. Howlett&rsquo;s already
perfect house.</p>
<p>On the ballroom floor are some ten or twenty couples
gracefully waltzing to the strains of Sullivan, and in the midst
of these we see Marguerite Andrews <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>threading her way across the room
with some difficulty, attended by Mr. and Mrs. Willard.&nbsp;
They have just arrived.&nbsp; As Marguerite walks across the hall
she attracts every one.&nbsp; There is that about her which
commands attention.&nbsp; At the instant of her entrance Count
Bonetti is on the <i>qui Vive</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Py Chove!&rdquo; he cries, as he leans gracefully
against the doorway opening into the conservatory.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Zare, my dear friend, zat iss my idea of ze truly
peautiful woman.&nbsp; Vat iss her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Miss Andrews of New York, Count,&rdquo; the
person addressed replies.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is up here with the
Willards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I musd meed her,&rdquo; says the Count, his eye
following Marguerite as she walks up to Mrs. Howlett and is
greeted effusively by that lady.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Marguerite is pale, and appears anxious.&nbsp; Even to
the author the ways of the women in his works are inscrutable; so
upon this occasion.&nbsp; She is pale, but I cannot say
why.&nbsp; Can it be that she has an intuitive knowledge that
to-night may decide her whole future life?&nbsp; Who can
tell?&nbsp; Woman&rsquo;s intuitions are great, and there be
those who say they are unerringly true.&nbsp; One by one, with
the exception of Count Bonetti, the young men among Mrs.
Howlett&rsquo;s guests are presented&mdash;Bonetti prefers to
await a more favorable opportunity&mdash;and to all Marguerite
appears to be the beautiful woman she is.&nbsp; Hers is an
instant success.&nbsp; A new beauty has dawned upon the Newport
horizon.</p>
<p>Let us describe her as she stands.</p>
<p>(<i>Note</i>.&mdash;There is a blank space left <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>here.&nbsp;
At first I thought it was because Harley wished to reflect a
little before drawing a picture of so superb a woman as he seemed
to think her, and go on to the conclusion of the chapter, the
main incidents being hot in his mind, and the purely descriptive
matters more easily left to calmer moments.&nbsp; He informs me,
however, that such was not the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I came to
describe her as she stood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she had
disappeared, and I had to search all over the house before I
finally found her in the conservatory.&nbsp; So I changed the
chapter to read thus:&rdquo;)</p>
<p>After a half-hour of dancing and holding court&mdash;for
Marguerite&rsquo;s triumph was truly that of a queen, it was so
complete&mdash;Miss Andrews turned to Mr. Willard and took his
arm.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;Let us go into the conservatory,&rdquo; she said,
in a whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard so much about Mrs.
Howlett&rsquo;s orchids, I should like to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willard, seeing that she was tired and slightly bored by the
incessant chatter of those about her, escorted her out through
the broad door into the conservatory.&nbsp; As she passed from
the ballroom the dark eyes of Count Bonetti flashed upon her, but
she heeded them not, moving on into the floral bower in
apparently serene unconsciousness of that person&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; Here Willard got her a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have an ice?&rdquo; he asked, as she seated
herself beneath one of the lofty palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
wait here alone if you will get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Willard
passed out, and soon returned with the ice; but as he came
through the doorway Bonetti stopped him and whispered something
in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Count, right away,&rdquo; Willard
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bonetti needed no second bidding, but followed Willard
closely, and soon stood expectant before Marguerite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Andrews,&rdquo; said Willard, &ldquo;may I have
the pleasure of presenting Count Bonetti?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count&rsquo;s head nearly collided with his toes in the
bow that he made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Willard,&rdquo; returned Miss Andrews, coldly,
ignoring the Count, &ldquo;feeling as I do that Count Bonetti is
merely a bogus Count with acquisitive instincts, brought here,
like myself, for literary purposes of which I cannot approve, I
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>must reply
to your question that you may not have that pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which remark (concludes Stuart Harley) Miss Marguerite
Andrews swept proudly from the room, ordered her carriage, and
went home, thereby utterly ruining the second story of her life
that I had undertaken to write.&nbsp; But I shall make one more
effort.</p>

AN EXPERIMENT</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>And thus I&rsquo;ll curb her mad and
headstrong humor</i>.<br />
<i>He that knows better how to tame a shrew</i>,<br />
<i>Now let him speak</i>; <i>&rsquo;tis charity to

<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;&ldquo;Taming of the
Shrew.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">What</span> would have happened if
she had behaved differently, Stuart?&rdquo; I asked, after I had
read the pages he had so kindly placed at my disposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing in particular to which she could reasonably
object,&rdquo; returned Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;The incidents of a
truly realistic novel are rarely objectionable, except to people
of a captious nature.&nbsp; I <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>intended to have Bonetti dance
attendance upon Miss Andrews for the balance of the season,
that&rsquo;s all, hoping thereby to present a good picture of
life at Newport in July and part of August.&nbsp; About the
middle of August I was going to transport the whole cast to Bar
Harbor, for variety&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; That would have been
another opportunity to get a good deal of the American summer
atmosphere into the book.&nbsp; I wish I could afford the kind of
summer I contemplated giving her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t intend that she should fall in love
with Bonetti?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to any serious extent,&rdquo; said Harley,
deprecatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even if she had a little, she&rsquo;d
have come out of it all right as soon as the hero turned up, and
she had a chance to see the difference <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>between a manly man of her own
country and a little titled fortune hunter from the land of
macaroni.&nbsp; Bonetti wasn&rsquo;t to be a bad fellow at
all.&nbsp; He was merely an Italian, which he couldn&rsquo;t
help, being born so, and therefore, as she said, of an
acquisitive nature.&nbsp; There is no villany in that,
however&mdash;that is, no reprehensible villany.&nbsp; He was
after a rich marriage because he was fond of a life of
ease.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d have found him amusing, at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was bogus!&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Harley, impatiently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what vexes me more than anything else.&nbsp;
She made a very bad mistake there.&nbsp; As a Count, Bonetti was
quite as real as his financial necessities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a beastly awkward situation, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>that
conservatory scene,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Especially for
Willard.&nbsp; The Count might have challenged him.&nbsp; What
became of the Count when it was over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
left him to get out of his predicament as best he could.&nbsp;
Possibly he did challenge Willard.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t taken
the trouble to find out.&nbsp; If, as I think, however,
he&rsquo;s a living person, he&rsquo;ll extricate himself from
his difficulty all right; if he&rsquo;s not, and I have
unwittingly allowed myself to conjure him up in my fancy,
there&rsquo;s no great harm done.&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s nothing
more than a marionette, let him fall on the floor, and stay there
until I find some imaginative writer who will take him off my
hands&mdash;you, for instance.&nbsp; You can have Bonetti for a
Christmas present, with my compliments.&nbsp; <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>I&rsquo;m
through with him; but as for Miss Andrews, she has been so
confoundedly elusive that she has aroused my deepest interest,
and I couldn&rsquo;t give her up if I wanted to.&nbsp; I never
encountered a heroine like her in all my life before, and the one
object of my future career will be to catch her finally in the
meshes of a romance.&nbsp; Romance will come into her life some
time.&nbsp; She is not at all of an unsentimental
nature&mdash;only fractious&mdash;new-womanish, perhaps; but none
the less lovable, and Cupid will have a shot at her when she
least expects it; and when it does come, I&rsquo;ll be on hand to
report the attempted assassination for the delectation of the
Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would try a little persuasion, just
for larks,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;You forget I am a realist,&rdquo; he replied, as
he went out.</p>
<p>Now I sincerely admired Stuart Harley, and I wished to the
bottom of my heart to help him if I could.&nbsp; It seemed to me
that, however admirable Miss Andrews had shown herself to be
generally as a woman, she had been an altogether unsatisfactory
person in the r&ocirc;le of a heroine.&nbsp; I respected her
scruples about marrying men she did not care for, and, as I have
already said, no one could deny her the right to her own
convictions; but it seemed to me that in the Bonetti incident she
might and truly ought to have acted differently when the time
came for the presentation.&nbsp; There is no doubt in my mind
that her little speech to Willard, in which she stated that the
Count was a <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>fraud and might not be presented, was a deliberately
planned rebuff, and therefore not in any sense excusable.&nbsp;
She could have avoided it by telling Willard before leaving home
that she did not care to meet the Count.&nbsp; To make a scene at
Mrs. Howlett&rsquo;s was not a thing which a sober-minded,
self-contained woman would have done; it was bad form to behave
so rudely to one of Mrs. Howlett&rsquo;s guests, and was so
inconsiderate of Willard and unreasonable in other ways that I
blamed her unreservedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She deserves to be punished,&rdquo; I thought to
myself, as Harley went dejectedly out of the room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And there is no kind of punishment for a woman like that
so galling to her soul as to find herself in the hands of a
relentless despot <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>who forces her this way and that, according to his
whim.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to play Petrucio to her Katherine for
five minutes.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d soon find out that I&rsquo;m not
a realist bound by a creed to which I must adhere.&nbsp; Whatever
I choose to do I can do without violating my conscientious
scruples, because I haven&rsquo;t any conscientious scruples in
literature.&nbsp; And, by Jove, I&rsquo;ll do it!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take Miss Marguerite Andrews in hand myself this very
afternoon, and I&rsquo;ll put her through a course of training
that will make her rue the day she ever trifled with Stuart
Harley&mdash;and when he takes her up again she&rsquo;ll be as
meek as Moses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strong in my belief that I could bring the young woman to
terms, I went to my desk and tried my hand at a story, with Miss
Andrews as its heroine, and I <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>was not particular about being
realistic either.&nbsp; Neither did I go off into any trances in
search of heroes and villains.&nbsp; I did what Harley could not
do.&nbsp; I brought the <i>New York</i> back to port that very
day, and despatched Robert Osborne, the despised lover of the
first tale, to Newport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall have him whether she likes him or not,&rdquo;
said I, gritting my teeth determinedly; &ldquo;and she
won&rsquo;t know whether she loves him or Count Bonetti best; and
she&rsquo;ll promise to marry both of them; and she shall go to
Venice in August, despite her uncompromising refusal to do so for
Harley; and she shall meet Balderstone there, and, no matter what
her opinion of him or of his literary work, she shall be
fascinated by the story I&rsquo;ll have him write, and under the
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>spell of
that fascination she shall promise to marry him also; whereupon
the Willards will turn up and take her to Heidelberg, where
I&rsquo;ll have her meet the hero she couldn&rsquo;t wait for at
the Howlett dance, the despised Professor, and she shall promise
to be his wife likewise; and finally I&rsquo;ll put her on board
a steamer at Southampton, bound for New York, with Mrs. Corwin
and the twins; and the second day out, when she is feeling her
very worst, all four of her fianc&eacute;s will turn up at the
same time beside her chair.&nbsp; Then I shall leave her to get
out of her trouble the best way she can.&nbsp; I imagine, after
she has had a taste of my literary regimen, she&rsquo;ll quite
fall in love with the Harley method, and behave herself as a
heroine should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat down all aglow with the idea of <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>being able
to tame Harley&rsquo;s heroine and place her in a mood more
suited for his purposes.&nbsp; The more I thought of how his
failures were weighing on his mind, the more viciously ready was
I to play the tyrant with Marguerite, and&mdash;well, I might as
well confess it at once, with all my righteous indignation
against her, I could not do it.&nbsp; Five times I started, and
as many times did I destroy what I wrote.&nbsp; On the sixth
trial I did haul the <i>New York</i> relentlessly back into port,
never for an instant considering the inconvenience of the
passengers, or the protests of the officers, crew, or postal
authorities.&nbsp; This done, I seized upon the unfortunate
Osborne, spirited his luggage through the Custom-house, and sent
the ship to sea again.&nbsp; That part was easy.&nbsp; I have
written a great deal <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>for the comic papers, and acrobatic
nonsense of that sort comes almost without an effort on my
part.&nbsp; With equal ease I got Osborne to Newport&mdash;how, I
do not recollect.&nbsp; It is just possible that I took him
through from New York without a train, by the mere say-so of my
pen.&nbsp; At any rate, I got him there, and I fully intended to
have him meet Miss Andrews at a dance at the Ocean House the day
after his arrival.&nbsp; I even progressed so far as to get up
the dance.&nbsp; I described the room, the decorations, and the
band.&nbsp; I had Osborne dressed and waiting, with Bonetti also
dressed and waiting on the other side of the room, Scylla and
Charybdis all over again, but by no possibility could I force
Miss Andrews to appear.&nbsp; Why it was, I do not pretend to be
able to say&mdash;she <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>may have known that Bonetti was
there, she may have realized that I was trying to force Osborne
upon her; but whatever it was that enabled her to do so, she
resisted me successfully&mdash;or my pen did; for that situation
upon which I had based the opening scene of my story of
compulsion I found beyond my ability to depict; and as Harley had
done before me, so was I now forced to do&mdash;to change my
plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have her run away with!&rdquo; I cried,
growing vicious in my wrath; &ldquo;and both Bonetti and Osborne
shall place her under eternal obligations by rushing out to stop
the horse, one from either side of the street.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll
have to meet Bonetti then,&rdquo; I added, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>And I tried that plan.&nbsp; As docile as a lamb she entered
the phaeton, which <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>I conjured up out of my ink-pot, and like a veteran
Jehu did she seize the reins.&nbsp; I could not help admiring her
as I wrote of it&mdash;she was so like a goddess; but I did not
relent.&nbsp; Run away with she must be, and run away with she
was.&nbsp; But again did this extraordinary woman assert herself
to my discomfiture; for the moment she saw Bonetti rushing out to
rescue her from the east, she jerked the left rein so violently
that the horse swerved to one side, toppled over on Osborne, who
had sprung gallantly to the rescue from the west; and Bonetti,
missing his aim as the horse turned, fell all in a heap in the
roadway two yards back of the phaeton.&nbsp; Miss Andrews was not
hurt, but my story was, for she had not even observed the unhappy
Osborne; and as for Bonetti, he <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>cut so ridiculous a figure that,
Italian though he was, even he seemed aware of it, and he shrank
dejectedly out of sight.&nbsp; Again had this supernaturally
elusive heroine upset the plans of one who had essayed to embalm
her virtues in a literary mould.&nbsp; I could not bring her into
contact with either of my heroes.</p>
<p>I threw my pen down in disgust, slammed to the cover of my
ink-well, and for two hours paced madly through the maze-like
walks of the Central Park, angry and depressed; and from that
moment until I undertook the narration of this pathetic story I
gave Harley&rsquo;s heroine up as unavailable material for my
purposes.&nbsp; She was worse, if anything, in imaginative work
than in realism, because she absolutely defied the imagination,
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>while
the realist she would be glad to help so long as his realism was
kept in strict accord with her ideas of what the real really
was.</p>
<p>It was some days before I saw Harley again, and I thought he
looked tired and anxious&mdash;so anxious, indeed, that I was
afraid he might possibly be in financial straits, for I knew that
for three weeks he had not turned out any of his usual
pot-boilers, having been too busy trying to write the story for
Messrs. Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick.&nbsp; It happened, oddly
enough, that I had two or three uncashed checks in my pocket; so,
feeling like a millionaire, I broached the subject to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old fellow?&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem in a blue funk.&nbsp; Has the mint
stopped?&nbsp; If it has, command <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m overburdened
with checks this week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; thanks just the same,&rdquo; he said,
wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Tiffin royalties came in Wednesday, and
I&rsquo;m all right for a while, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, then, Stuart?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You look worried.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just offered to share
my prosperity with you, you might share your grief with me.&nbsp;
Lend me a peck of trouble overnight, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing much,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that rebellious heroine of mine.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s weighing on my mind, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s very real to me, that woman; and, by Jove! I&rsquo;ve
been as jealous as a lover for two days over a fancy that came
into my head.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll laugh when I tell you, but
I&rsquo;ve been half afraid somebody else <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>would take
her up and&mdash;well, treat her badly.&nbsp; There is something
that tells me that she has been forced into some brutal situation
by somebody, somewhere, within the past two or three days.&nbsp;
I believe I&rsquo;d want to kill a man who did that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t laugh at him.&nbsp; I was the man who was in a
fair way to get killed for &ldquo;doing that,&rdquo; and I
thought laughter would be a little bit misplaced; but I am not a
coward, and I didn&rsquo;t flinch.&nbsp; I confessed.&nbsp; I
tried to ease his mind by telling him what I had attempted to
do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; he said, shortly, when I had
finished.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you must promise me one thing,&rdquo;
he added, very seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise anything,&rdquo; I said, meekly.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever try anything of the sort
again,&rdquo; he went on, gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you had
succeeded in writing that story, and subjected her to all that
horror, I should never have spoken to you again.&nbsp; As it is,
I realize that what you did was out of the kindness of your
heart, prompted by a desire to be of service to me, and I&rsquo;m
just as much obliged as I can be, only I don&rsquo;t want any
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until you ask me to, Stuart,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never write another line about her; but
you&rsquo;d better keep very mum about her yourself, or get her
copyrighted.&nbsp; The way she upset that horse on Osborne,
completely obliterating him, and at the same time getting out of
the way of that little simian Count, in spite of all I could do
to place her under obligations to both of them, was what the <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>ancients
would have called a caution.&nbsp; She has made a slave of me
forever, and I venture to predict that if you don&rsquo;t hurry
up and get her into a book, somebody else will; and whoever does
will make a name for himself alongside of which that of Smith
will sink into oblivion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count on me for that,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Faint heart never won fair lady,&rsquo; and I
don&rsquo;t intend to stop climbing just because I fear a few
more falls.&rdquo;</p>

ANOTHER CHAPTER FROM HARLEY</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Was ever woman in this humour
woo&rsquo;d</i>?<br />
<i>Was ever woman in this humour won</i>?<br />
<i>I&rsquo;ll have her</i>,&mdash;<i>but I will not keep her
long</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;&ldquo;Richard
III.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no doubt about it that
Harley, true to his purpose, was making a good fight to conquer
without compulsion, and appreciated as much as I the necessity of
reducing his heroine to concrete form as speedily as possible,
lest some other should prove more successful, and so deprive him
of the laurels for which he had worked so hard and suffered so
much.&nbsp; In his favor was his <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>disposition.&nbsp; He was a man of
great determination, and once he set about doing something he was
not an easy man to turn aside, and now that, for the first time
in his life, he found himself baffled at every point, and by a
heroine of no very great literary importance, he became more
determined than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll conquer yet,&rdquo; he said to me, a week or
so later; but the weariness with which he spoke made me fear that
victory was afar off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of it&mdash;ultimately,&rdquo; I
answered, to encourage him; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you think
you&rsquo;ll stand a better chance if you let her rest for a
while, and then steal in upon her unawares, and catch her little
romance as it flies?&nbsp; She is apparently nerved up against
you now, and the more conscious she is of your <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>efforts to
put her on paper, the more she will rebel.&nbsp; In fact, her
rebelliousness will become more and more a matter of whim than of
principle, unless you let up on her for a little while.&nbsp;
Half of her opposition now strikes me as obstinacy, and the more
you try to break her spirit, even though you do it gently, the
more stubborn will she become.&nbsp; Put this book aside for a
few weeks anyhow.&nbsp; Why not tackle something else?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d do better work, too, after a little
variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be finished by September 1st, that&rsquo;s
why not,&rdquo; said Stuart.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised
Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick to send them the completed
manuscript by that time.&nbsp; Besides, no heroine of mine shall
ever say that she swerved me from doing what I have set <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>about
doing.&nbsp; It is now or never with Marguerite
Andrews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I left him at his desk, and for a week was busy with my own
affairs.&nbsp; Late the following Friday night I dropped in at
Harley&rsquo;s rooms to see how matters were progressing.&nbsp;
As I entered I saw him at his desk, his back turned towards me,
silhouetted in the lamp-light, scratching away furiously with his
pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I thought, as my eye took in the picture,
&ldquo;it goes at last.&nbsp; I guess I won&rsquo;t disturb his
train of thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I tried to steal softly out, for he had not observed my
entrance.&nbsp; As luck would have it, I stepped upon the sill of
the door as I passed out, and it creaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Harley, wheeling about in his
chair, startled by the sound.&nbsp; <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you, is
it?&rdquo; he added, as he recognized me.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are
you up to?&nbsp; Come back here.&nbsp; I want to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was cheerful, but I could see that the cheerfulness
was assumed.&nbsp; The color had completely left his cheeks, and
great rings under his eyes betokened weariness of spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you,&rdquo; said I,
returning.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to have your pen on a clear
track, with full steam up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had,&rdquo; he said, quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was just
finishing up that Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; I cried, grasping his hand and shaking
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I congratulate you.&nbsp; Success at last,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got something done&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said, and he tossed the letter <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>block upon
which he had been writing across the table to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Read that, and tell me what you think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I read it over carefully.&nbsp; It was a letter to Messrs.
Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick, in which Stuart asked to be
relieved of the commission he had undertaken:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I find myself utterly unable to complete
the work in the stipulated time,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;for
reasons entirely beyond my control.&nbsp; Nor can I at this
writing say with any degree of certainty when I shall be able to
finish the story.&nbsp; I have made constant and conscientious
effort to carry out my agreement with you, but fruitlessly, and I
beg that you will relieve me of the obligation into <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>which I
entered at the signing of our contract.&nbsp; Of course I could
send you something long enough to cover the required
space&mdash;words come easy enough for that&mdash;but the result
would be unsatisfactory to you and injurious to me were I to do
so.&nbsp; Please let me hear from you, releasing me from the
obligation, at your earliest convenience, as I am about to leave
town for a fortnight&rsquo;s rest.&nbsp; Regretting my inability
to serve you at this time, and hoping soon to be able to avail
myself of your very kind offer, I beg to remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours faithfully,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Stuart Harley</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve finished
it, then, by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By giving it up,&rdquo; said he, sadly.&nbsp; <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest thing that ever
happened to me, but that girl is impossible.&nbsp; I take up my
pen intending to say that she did this, and before I know it she
does that.&nbsp; I cannot control my story at all, nor can I
perceive in what given direction she will go.&nbsp; If I could, I
could arrange my <i>scenario</i> to suit, but as it is, I cannot
go on.&nbsp; It may come later, but it won&rsquo;t come now, and
I&rsquo;m going to give her up, and go down to Barnegat to fish
for ten days.&nbsp; I hate to give the book up, though,&rdquo; he
added, tapping the table with his pen-holder reflectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Chadwick&rsquo;s an awfully good fellow, and his firm is
one of the best in the country, liberal and all that, and here at
my first opportunity to get on their list, I&rsquo;m completely
floored.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s beastly hard luck, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be floored,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take my advice and tackle something else.&nbsp; Write some
other book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the devil of it!&rdquo; he replied,
angrily pounding the table with his fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried, and I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; My
mind is full of that woman.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t get rid of her
I&rsquo;m ruined&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to get a position as a
salesman somewhere, or starve, for until she is caught between
good stiff board covers I can&rsquo;t write another
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you take too serious a view of it, Stuart,&rdquo; I
ventured.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad and tired now.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t blame you, of course, but you mustn&rsquo;t be
rash.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t send that letter yet.&nbsp; Wait until
you&rsquo;ve had the week at Barnegat&mdash;you&rsquo;ll feel
better then.&nbsp; You can write the book in ten days after your
return; or if you <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>still find you can&rsquo;t do it, it will be time
enough to withdraw then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hope is there after that?&rdquo; he cried, tossing
a bundle of manuscript into my lap.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just read that,
and tell me what&rsquo;s the use.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d mapped out a
meeting between Marguerite Andrews and a certain Mr. Arthur
Parker, a fellow with wealth, position, brains, good
looks&mdash;in short, everything a girl could ask for, and
that&rsquo;s what came of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spread the pages out upon the table before me and read:</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
A DECLARATION</h3>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>I
have not seen</i><br />
<i>So likely an ambassador of love</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;&ldquo;Merchant of
Venice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parker mounted the steps lightly and rang the bell.&nbsp;
Marguerite&rsquo;s kindness <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>of the night before, which was in
marked contrast to her coolness at the MacFarland dance, had led
him to believe that he was not wholly without interest to her,
and her invitation that he should call upon her had given him a
sincere pleasure; in fact, he wondered that he should be so
pleased over so trivial a circumstance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve lost my heart again,&rdquo;
he said to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is, again if I ever lost it
before,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>And his mind reverted to a little episode at Bar Harbor the
summer before, and he was not sorry to feel that that wound was
cured&mdash;though, as a matter of fact, it had never amounted to
more than a scratch.</p>
<p>A moment later the door opened, <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and Parker entered, inquiring for
Miss Andrews as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but I will see if Miss Andrews is at
home,&rdquo; said the butler, ushering him into the parlor.&nbsp;
That imposing individual knew quite well that Miss Andrews was at
home, but he also knew that it was not his place to say so until
the young lady had personally assured him of the facts in so far
as they related to this particular caller.&nbsp; All went well
for Parker, however.&nbsp; Miss Andrews consented to be at home
to him, and five minutes later she entered the drawing room where
Parker was seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said, frigidly, ignoring his
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Think of that, will you?&rdquo; interposed
Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d come to propose, and <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>was to
leave engaged, and she insists upon opening upon him frigidly,
ignoring his outstretched hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you let
her do it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could no more have changed it than I could
fly,&rdquo; returned Stuart.&nbsp; &ldquo;She ought never to have
been at home if she was going to behave that way.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t foresee the incident, and before I knew it
that&rsquo;s the way it happened.&nbsp; But I thought I could fix
it up later, so I went on.&nbsp; Read along, and see what I got
let into next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I proceeded to read as follows:)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Parker, with an admiring glance at
her eyes, in spite of the fact that the coolness of her reception
rather abashed him&mdash;&ldquo;you see, I have not delayed very
long in coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>&ldquo;So I perceive,&rdquo; returned Marguerite, with
a bored manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said to Mrs.
Willard as I came down.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t allow your friends
much leeway, Mr. Parker.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t seem more than
five minutes since we were together at the card party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cordial, eh?&rdquo; said Harley, as I
read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice sort of talk for a heroine to a
hero.&nbsp; Makes it easy for me, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say if you manage to get a proposal in now
you&rsquo;re a genius,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;as for that, I got reckless when I saw how
things were going,&rdquo; returned Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I lost my
temper, and took it out of poor Parker.&nbsp; He proposes, as you
will see when you come to it; but it isn&rsquo;t
realism&mdash;it&rsquo;s compulsion.&nbsp; I simply forced him
into it&mdash;poor devil.&nbsp; But go on and read for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>I did
so, as follows:)</p>
<p>This was hardly the treatment Parker had expected at the hands
of one who had been undeniably gracious to him at the card-table
the night before.&nbsp; He had received the notice that she was
to be his partner at the tables with misgivings, on his arrival
at Mrs. Stoughton&rsquo;s, because his recollection of her
behavior towards him at the MacFarland dance had led him to
believe that he was personally distasteful to her; but as the
evening at cards progressed he felt instinctively drawn towards
her, and her vivacity of manner, cleverness at repartee, and
extreme amiability towards himself had completely won his heart,
which victory their little t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te during
supper had confirmed.&nbsp; But here, this morning, was reversion
to her first attitude.&nbsp; <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>What could it mean?&nbsp; Why should
she treat him so?</p>
<p>(&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t answer that question to save my
life,&rdquo; said Stuart.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is, not then, but I
found out later.&nbsp; I put it in, however, and let Parker draw
his own conclusions.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have helped him out if I
could, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Go on and see for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I resumed.)</p>
<p>Parker could not solve the problem, but it pleased him to
believe that something over which he had no control had gone
wrong that morning, and that this had disturbed her equanimity,
and that he was merely the victim of circumstances; and somehow
or other it pleased him also to think that he could be the victim
of her circumstances, so he stood his ground.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;It is a beautiful day,&rdquo; he began, after a
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she asked, indifferently.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Frightfully snubbish,&rdquo; said I, appalled at the
lengths to which Miss Andrews was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadfully,&rdquo; sighed Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so
unlike her, too.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;so very beautiful that
it seemed a pity that you and I should stay indoors, with plenty
of walks to be taken and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marguerite interrupted him with a sarcastic laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With so much pity and so many walks, Mr. Parker, why
don&rsquo;t you take a few of them!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the
worst act of rebellion yet.&nbsp; She seems beside
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;Read on!&rdquo; said Harley, in sepulchral
tones.)</p>
<p>This was Parker&rsquo;s opportunity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not
fond of walking, Miss Andrews,&rdquo; he said; and then he added,
quickly, &ldquo;that is, alone&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like anything
alone.&nbsp; Living alone, like walking alone,
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go walking,&rdquo; said Marguerite,
shortly, as she rose up from her chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be down in two minutes.&nbsp; I only need to put my hat
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker acquiesced, and Miss Andrews walked majestically out of
the parlor and went up-stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; muttered Parker, as she left
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A minute more, and I&rsquo;d have known my
fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d made up
my mind that that proposal should take <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>place in
that chapter, and I thought I&rsquo;d worked right up to it, in
spite of all Miss Andrews&rsquo;s disagreeable remarks when,
pop&mdash;off she goes to put on her hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;as for that&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Parker had suggested the walk,
and a girl really does like to stave off a proposal as long as
she can when she knows it is sure to come.&nbsp; Furthermore, it
gives you a chance to describe the hat, and so make up for a few
of the words you lost when she refused to discuss ball-dresses
with Mrs. Willard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that; but don&rsquo;t you think I
worked up to the proposal skilfully?&rdquo; asked Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re
dreadfully hard on Parker.&nbsp; It would have been <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>better to
have had the butler fire him out, head over heels.&nbsp; He could
have thrashed the butler for doing that, but with your heroine
his hands were tied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and read,&rdquo; said Harley.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have known what I was driving at,&rdquo;
Parker reflected, as he awaited her return.&nbsp; &ldquo;Possibly
she loves me in spite of this frigid behavior.&nbsp; This may be
her method of concealing it; but if it is, I must confess
it&rsquo;s a case of</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Perhaps it was right to dissemble your
love,<br />
But&mdash;why did you kick me down-stairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Certainly, knowing, as she now must, what my feelings are, her
being willing to go for a walk on the cliffs, or anywhere, is a
favorable sign.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Parker merely echoed my own <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>hope in
that remark,&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I could get them
engaged, I was satisfied to do it in any way that might be
pleasing to her.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>A moment later Marguerite appeared, arrayed for the
walk.&nbsp; Parker rose as she entered and picked up his
gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a perfect picture this morning,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; she said, shortly, ignoring the
compliment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are we scheduled to walk?&mdash;or
are we to have something to say about it ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker looked at her with a wondering smile.&nbsp; The aptness
of the remark did not strike him.&nbsp; However, he was equal to
the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in free will, then?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;It was the only intelligent remark <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>he could
make, under the circumstances, you see,&rdquo; explained
Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a clever fellow,&rdquo; said I, and resumed
reading.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in a great many things we are supposed to do
without,&rdquo; said Marguerite, sharply.</p>
<p>They had reached the street, and in silence walked along
Bellevue Avenue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p136b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a great many things,&rdquo; vouchsafed
Parker, as they turned out of the avenue to the cliffs,
&ldquo;that men are supposed not to do without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marguerite,
sharply&mdash;&ldquo;vices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not refer to them,&rdquo; laughed Parker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In fact, Miss Andrews, the heart of man is supposed to be
incomplete until he has lost it, and has succeeded in getting
another for his very&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;Are you an admirer of Max Nordau?&rdquo;
interposed Marguerite, quickly.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Whatever led you to put that in?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put it in.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what she
said.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not responsible.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about Max Nordau,&rdquo;
said Parker, somewhat surprised at this sudden turn of the
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you familiar with Schopenhauer?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;It was awfully rough on the poor fellow,&rdquo; said
Harley, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t help him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
forced him in so far that I couldn&rsquo;t get him out.&nbsp; His
answer floored me as completely as anything that Miss Andrews
ever did.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schopenhauer?&rdquo; said Parker, nonplussed.&nbsp; <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>&ldquo;Oh
yes,&rdquo; he added, an idea dawning on his mind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is to say, moderately familiar&mdash;though, as a
matter of fact, I&rsquo;m not at all musical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Andrews laughed immoderately, in which Parker, thinking
that he had possibly said something witty, although he did not
know what it was, joined.&nbsp; In a moment the laughter
subsided, and for a few minutes the two walked on in
silence.&nbsp; Finally Parker spoke, resignedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Andrews,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps you have
noticed&mdash;perhaps not&mdash;that you have strongly interested
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, turning upon him
desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have noticed it, and that is why I
have on two separate occasions tried to keep you from saying
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;And why should I not tell you that I
love&mdash;&rdquo; began Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is hopeless,&rdquo; retorted
Marguerite.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am perfectly well aware, Mr. Parker,
what we are down for, and I suppose I cannot blame you for your
persistence.&nbsp; Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know any better;
perhaps you do know better, but are willing to give yourself over
unreservedly into the hands of another; perhaps you are being
forced and cannot help yourself.&nbsp; It is just possible that
you are a professional hero, and feel under obligations to your
employer to follow out his wishes to the letter.&nbsp; However it
may be, you have twice essayed to come to the point, and I have
twice tried to turn you aside.&nbsp; Now it is time to speak
truthfully.&nbsp; I admire and like you very much, but I <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>have a will
of my own, am nobody&rsquo;s puppet, and if Stuart Harley never
writes another book in his life, he shall not marry me to a man I
do not love; and, frankly, I do not love you.&nbsp; I do not know
if you are aware of the fact, but it is true nevertheless that
you are the third <i>fianc&eacute;</i> he has tried to thrust
upon me since July 3d.&nbsp; Like the others, if you insist upon
blindly following his will, and propose marriage to me, you shall
go by the board.&nbsp; I have warned you, and you can now do as
you please.&nbsp; You were saying&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I love you with all my soul,&rdquo; said Parker,
grimly.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t really love her then, you know,&rdquo;
said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d been cured of that in five
minutes.&nbsp; But I was resolved <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>that he should say it, and he
did.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how he came to say it grimly.&nbsp; He
did it just as a soldier rushes up to the cannon&rsquo;s
mouth.&nbsp; He added, also:&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly not,&rdquo; said Marguerite, turning on
her heel, and leaving the young man to finish his walk alone.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said Harley, with a chuckle,
&ldquo;Parker&rsquo;s manhood would assert itself in spite of all
I could do.&nbsp; He made an answer, which I wrote
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve scratched
it out.&nbsp; What was that line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Thank the Lord!&rdquo; said Parker to
himself, as Miss Andrews disappeared around the
corner,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Stuart Harley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wrote, and I flatter myself on the
realism of it, for that&rsquo;s <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>just what any self-respecting hero
would have said under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence came over us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wonder I&rsquo;ve given it up,&rdquo; asked
Stuart, after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I do.&nbsp; Such opposition
would nerve me up to a battle royal.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t give
it up until I&rsquo;d returned from Barnegat, if I were
you,&rdquo; I added, anxious to have him renew his efforts; for
an idea had just flashed across my mind, which, although it
involved a breach of faith on my part, I nevertheless believed to
be good and justifiable, since it might relieve Stuart Harley of
his embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I rejoiced to hear him say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give it up until then, but I haven&rsquo;t
much hope after that last chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>So
Harley went to Barnegat, after destroying his letter to Messrs.
Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick, whilst I put my breach of faith
into operation.)</p>

A BREACH OF FAITH</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Having sworn too hard-a-keeping
oath</i>,<br />
<i>Study to break it</i>, <i>and not to break my

<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s
Labor&rsquo;s Lost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I assured Harley that I should
keep my hands off his heroine until he requested me to do
otherwise, after my fruitless attempt to discipline her into a
less refractory mood, I fully intended to keep my promise.&nbsp;
She was his, as far as she possessed any value as literary
material, and he had as clear a right to her exclusive use as if
she had been copyrighted in his name&mdash;at least so far as his
friends were concerned he had.&nbsp; <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Others might make use of her for
literary purposes with a clear conscience if they chose to do so,
but the hand of a friend must be stayed.&nbsp; Furthermore, my
own experience with the young woman had not been successful
enough to lead me to believe that I could conquer where Harley
had been vanquished.&nbsp; Physical force I had found to be
unavailing.&nbsp; She was too cunning to stumble into any of the
pitfalls that with all my imagination I could conjure up to
embarrass her; but something had to be done, and I now resolved
upon a course of moral suasion, and wholly for Harley&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; The man was actually suffering because she had so
persistently defied him, and his discomfiture was all the more
deplorable because it meant little short of the ruin of his life
and <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>ambitions.&nbsp; The problem had to be solved or his
career was at an end.&nbsp; Harley never could do two things at
once.&nbsp; The task he had in hand always absorbed his whole
being until he was able to write the word finis on the last page
of his manuscript, and until the finis to this elusive book he
was now struggling with was written, I knew that he would write
no other.&nbsp; His pot-boilers he could do, of course, and so
earn a living, but pot-boilers destroy rather than make
reputations, and Harley was too young a man to rest upon past
achievements; neither had he done such vastly superior work that
his fame could withstand much diminution by the continuous
production of ephemera.&nbsp; It was therefore in the hope of
saving him that I broke faith with him and temporarily stole his
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>heroine.&nbsp; I did not dream of using her at all, as
you might think, as a heroine of my own, but rather as an
interesting person with ideas as to the duty of heroines&mdash;a
sort of Past Grand Mistress of the Art of Heroinism&mdash;who was
worth interviewing for the daily press.&nbsp; I flatter myself it
was a good idea, worthy almost of a genius, though I am perfectly
well aware that I am not a genius.&nbsp; I am merely a man of
exceptional talent.&nbsp; I have talent enough for a genius, but
no taste for the unconventional, and by just so much do I fall
short of the realization of the hopes of my friends and fears of
my enemies.&nbsp; There are stories I have in mind that are
worthy of the most exalted French masters, for instance, and when
I have the time to be careful, which <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>I rarely do, I can write with the
polished grace of a De Maupassant or a James, but I shall never
write them, because I value my social position too highly to put
my name to anything which it would never do to publish outside of
Paris.&nbsp; I do not care to prove my genius at the cost of the
respect of my neighbors&mdash;all of which, however, is foreign
to my story, and is put in here merely because I have observed
that readers are very much interested in their favorite authors,
and like to know as much about them as they can.</p>
<p>My plan, to take up the thread of my narrative once more, was,
briefly, to write an interview between myself, as a
representative of a newspaper syndicate, and Miss Marguerite
Andrews, the &ldquo;Well-Known Heroine.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>quite
common of late years to interview the models of well-known
artists, so that it did not require too great a stretch of the
imagination to make my scheme a reasonable one.&nbsp; It must be
remembered, too, that I had no intention of using this interview
for my own aggrandizement.&nbsp; I planned it solely in the
interests of my friend, hoping that I might secure from Miss
Andrews some unguarded admission that might operate against her
own principles, as Harley and I knew them, and that, that
secured, I might induce her to follow meekly his schedule until
he could bring his story to a reasonable conclusion.&nbsp;
Failing in this, I was going to try and discover what style of
man it was she admired most, what might be her ideas of the
romance in <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>which she would most like to figure, and all that, so
that I could give Harley a few points which would enable him so
to construct his romance that his heroine would walk through it
as easily and as docilely as one could wish.&nbsp; Finally, all
other things failing, I was going to throw Harley on her
generosity, call attention to the fact that she was ruining him
by her stubborn behavior, and ask her to submit to a little
temporary inconvenience for his sake.</p>
<p>As I have already said, so must I repeat, there was genius in
the idea, but I was forced to relinquish certain features of it,
as will be seen shortly.&nbsp; I took up my pen, and with three
bold strokes thereof transported myself to Newport, and going
directly to the Willard Cottage, I rang the bell.&nbsp; Miss
Andrews <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>was still elusive.&nbsp; With all the resources of
imagination at hand, and with not an obstacle in my way that I
could not clear at a bound, she still held me at bay.&nbsp; She
was not at home&mdash;had, in fact, departed two days previously
for the White Mountains.&nbsp; Fortunately, however, the butler
knew her address, and, without bothering about trains, luggage,
or aught else, in one brief paragraph I landed myself at the
Profile House, where she was spending a week with Mr. and Mrs.
Rushton of Brooklyn.&nbsp; This change of location caused me to
modify my first idea, to its advantage.&nbsp; I saw, when I
thought the matter over, that, on the whole, the interview, as an
interview for a newspaper syndicate, was likely to be nipped in
the bud, since the moment I declared myself <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>a reporter
for a set of newspapers, and stated the object of my call, she
would probably dismiss me with the statement that she was not a
professional heroine, that her views were of no interest to the
public, and that, not having the pleasure of my acquaintance, she
must beg to be excused.&nbsp; I wonder I didn&rsquo;t think of
this at the outset.&nbsp; I surely knew Harley&rsquo;s heroine
well enough to have foreseen this possibility.&nbsp; I realized
it, however, the moment I dropped myself into the great homelike
office of the Profile House.&nbsp; Miss Andrews walked through
the office to the dining-room as I registered, and as I turned to
gaze upon her as she passed majestically on, it flashed across my
mind that it would be far better to appear before her as a
fellow-guest, and <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>find out what I wanted and tell her why I had come in
that guise, rather than introduce myself as one of those young
men who earn their daily bread by poking their noses into other
people&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>Had this course been based upon any thing more solid than a
pure bit of imagination, I should have found it difficult to
accommodate myself so easily to circumstances.&nbsp; If it had
been Harley instead of myself, it would have been impossible, for
Harley would never have stooped to provide himself with a trunk
containing fresh linen and evening-dress clothes and
patent-leather pumps by a stroke of his pen.&nbsp; This I did,
however, and that evening, having created another guest, who knew
me of old and who also was acquainted with Miss <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Andrews,
just as I had created my excellent wardrobe, I was presented.</p>
<p>The evening passed pleasantly enough, and I found
Harley&rsquo;s heroine to be all that he had told me and a great
deal more besides.&nbsp; In fact, so greatly did I enjoy her
society that I intentionally prolonged the evening to about three
times its normal length&mdash;which was a very inartistic bit of
exaggeration, I admit; but then I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a
realist, and when I sit down to write I can make my evenings as
long or as short as I choose.&nbsp; I will say, however, that,
long as my evening was, I made it go through its whole length
without having recourse to such copy-making subterfuges as the
description of doorknobs and chairs; and except for its unholy
length, it was not at all lacking in <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>realism.&nbsp; Miss Andrews
fascinated me and seemed to find me rather good company, and I
found myself suggesting that as the next day was Sunday she take
me for a walk.&nbsp; From what I knew of Harley&rsquo;s
experience with her, I judged she&rsquo;d be more likely to go if
I asked her to take me instead of offering to take her.&nbsp; It
was a subtle distinction, but with some women subtle distinctions
are chasms which men must not try to overleap too vaingloriously,
lest disaster overtake them.&nbsp; My bit of subtlety worked like
a charm.&nbsp; Miss Andrews graciously accepted my suggestion,
and I retired to my couch feeling certain that during that walk
to Bald Mountain, or around the Lake, or down to the Farm, or
wherever else she might choose to take me, I could do much to
help <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>poor Stuart out of the predicament into which his
luckless choice of Miss Andrews as his heroine had plunged
him.&nbsp; And I wasn&rsquo;t far wrong, as the event transpired,
although the manner in which it worked out was not exactly
according to my schedule.</p>
<p>I dismissed the night with a few paragraphs; the morning, with
its divine service in the parlor, went quickly and impressively;
for it <i>is</i> an impressive sight to see gathered beneath
those towering cliffs a hundred or more of pleasure and health
seekers of different creeds worshipping heartily and simply
together, as accordantly as though they knew no differences and
all men were possessed of one common religion&mdash;it was too
impressive, indeed, for my pen, which has been largely given over
to matters of <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>less moment, and I did not venture to touch upon it,
passing hastily over to the afternoon, when Miss Andrews
appeared, ready for the stroll.</p>
<p>I gazed at her admiringly for a moment, and then I began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the costume you wore&rdquo;&mdash;I was going
to say, &ldquo;when you rejected Parker?&rdquo; but I fortunately
caught my error in time to pass it off&mdash;&ldquo;at
Newport?&rdquo;&nbsp; I finished, with a half gasp at the
narrowness of my escape; for, it must be remembered, I was
supposed as yet to know nothing of that episode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know what I wore at Newport?&rdquo; she
asked, quickly&mdash;so quickly that I almost feared she had
found me out, after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;ah&mdash;I read about you somewhere,&rdquo; I
stammered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some newspaper <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>correspondent drew a picture of the scene on the
promenade in the afternoon, and&mdash;ah&mdash;he had you
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she replied, arching her eyebrows;
&ldquo;that was it, was it?&nbsp; And do you waste your valuable
time reading the vulgar effusions of the society
reporter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t I glad that I had not come as a man with a nose
to project into the affairs of others&mdash;as a newspaper
reporter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;not generally;
but I happened to see this particular item, and read it and
remembered it.&nbsp; After all,&rdquo; I added, as we came to the
sylvan path that leads to the Lake&mdash;&ldquo;after all, one
might as well read that sort of stuff as most of the novels of
the present day.&nbsp; The <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>vulgar reporter may be ignorant or a
boor, and all that is reprehensible in his methods, but he writes
about real flesh and blood people; and, what is worse, he
generally approximates the truth concerning them in his writing,
which is more than can be said of the so-called realistic novel
writers of the day.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t read a novel in three
years in which it has seemed to me that the heroine, for
instance, was anything more than a marionette, with no will of
her own, and ready to do at any time any foolish thing the author
wanted her to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again those eyes of Miss Andrews rested on me in a manner
which gave me considerable apprehension.&nbsp; Then she laughed,
and I was at ease again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very amusing,&rdquo; she said, quietly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The most amusing of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>The
remark nettled me, and I quickly retorted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have not lived in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do really live, then, eh?&rdquo; she asked, half
chaffingly, gazing at me out of the corners of her eyes in a
fashion which utterly disarmed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Andrews,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but
I am afraid I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, the smile
leaving her lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fact that you are here on the
errand you have charged yourself with proves that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not aware,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I have come
on any particularly ridiculous errand.&nbsp; May I ask you what
you mean by the expression &lsquo;most amusing of them
all&rsquo;?&nbsp; Am I one among many, and, if so, one what among
many what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;Your errand is a good one,&rdquo; she said,
gravely, &ldquo;and not at all ridiculous; let me assure you that
I appreciate that fact.&nbsp; Your question I will answer by
asking another: Are you here of your own volition, or has Stuart
Harley created you, as he did Messrs. Osborne, Parker, and the
Professor?&nbsp; Are you my new hero, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question irritated me.&nbsp; This woman was not content
with interfering seriously with my friend&rsquo;s happiness: she
was actually attributing me to him, casting doubts upon my
existence, and placing me in the same category with
herself&mdash;a mere book creature.&nbsp; To a man who regards
himself as being the real thing, flesh and blood, and, well,
eighteen-carat flesh and blood at that, to be accused of living
only a figmentary <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>existence is too much.&nbsp; I retorted angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you consider me nothing more than an idea, you do
not manifest your usual astuteness,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Her reply laid me flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not consider you anything of the sort.&nbsp; I
never so much as associated you with anything resembling an
idea.&nbsp; I merely asked a question,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I repeat it.&nbsp; Do you or do you not exist?&nbsp; Are
you a bit of the really real or a bit of Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
realism?&nbsp; In short, are you here at Profile Lake, walking
and talking with me, or are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A realizing sense of my true position crept over me.&nbsp; In
reality I was not there talking to her, but in my den in New York
writing about her.&nbsp; I may not be a realist, but I am
truthful.&nbsp; I <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>could not deceive her, so I replied, hesitatingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Andrews, I am&mdash;no, I am not here,
except in spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; she said,
demurely.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do you exist somewhere, or is this a
&lsquo;situation&rsquo; calculated to delight the American
girl&mdash;with pin-money to spend on Messrs. Herring, Beemer,
&amp; Chadwick&rsquo;s publications?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do exist,&rdquo; I replied, meekly; for, I must
confess it, I realized more than ever that Miss Andrews was too
much for me, and I heartily wished I was well out of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I alone am responsible for this.&nbsp; Harley is off
fishing at Barnegat&mdash;and do you know why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume he has gone there to recuperate,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;After his ungentlemanly, discourteous, and
wholly uncalled-for interference with my comfort at
Newport,&rdquo; she said, her face flushing and tears coming into
her eyes, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder he&rsquo;s
prostrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know to what you refer,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to the episode of the runaway horse,&rdquo; she
said, in wrathful remembrance of the incident.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I refuse to follow blindly his will, he abuses his
power, places me in a false and perilous situation, from which I,
a defenceless woman, must rescue myself alone and unaided.&nbsp;
It was unmanly of him&mdash;and I will pay him the compliment of
saying wholly unlike him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood aghast.&nbsp; Poor Stuart was being blamed for my
act.&nbsp; He must be <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>set right at once, however
unpleasant it might be for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; I said,
slowly; &ldquo;it was I.&nbsp; I wrote that bit of nonsense; and
he&mdash;well, he was mad because I did it, and said he&rsquo;d
like to kill any man who ill-treated you; and he made me promise
never to touch upon your life again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask why you did that?&rdquo; she asked, and I was
glad to note that there was no displeasure in her voice&mdash;in
fact, she seemed to cheer up wonderfully when I told her that it
was I, and not Stuart, who had subjected her to the
misadventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was angry with you,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were ruining my friend with your continued acts of
rebellion: he was successful; now he is ruined.&nbsp; He thinks
of you day and night&mdash;he wants you for his heroine; he wants
to make you happy, but he wants you to be happy in your own way;
and when he thinks he has discovered your way, he works along
that line, and all of a sudden, by some act wholly unforeseen,
and, if I may say so, unforeseeable, you treat him and his work
with contempt, draw yourself out of it&mdash;and he has to begin
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why have you ventured to break your word to your
friend?&rdquo; she asked, calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely you are
touching upon my life now, in spite of your promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am willing to sacrifice my word to his
welfare,&rdquo; I retorted; &ldquo;to try to make you understand
how you are blocking the path of a mighty fine-minded man by your
devotion to what <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>you call your independence.&nbsp; He will never ask you
to do anything that he knows will be revolting to you, and until
he has succeeded in pleasing you to the last page of his book he
will never write again.&nbsp; I have done this in the hope of
persuading you, at the cost even of some personal discomfort, not
to rebel against his gentle leadership&mdash;to fall in with his
ideas until he can fulfil this task of his, whether it be realism
or pure speculation on his part.&nbsp; If you do this, Stuart is
saved.&nbsp; If you do not, literature will be called upon to
mourn one who promises to be one of its brightest
ornaments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped short.&nbsp; Miss Andrews was gazing pensively out
over the mirror-like surface of the Lake.&nbsp; Finally she
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may tell Mr. Harley,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh,
&ldquo;that I will trouble him no more.&nbsp; He can do with me
as he pleases in all save one particular.&nbsp; He shall not
marry me to a man I do not love.&nbsp; If he takes the man I love
for my hero, then will I follow him to the death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask who that man is?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>&ldquo;You may ask if you please,&rdquo; she replied,
with a little smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t answer you,
except to say that it isn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And am I forgiven for my runaway story?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
expect me to condemn a man for loyalty to his friend, would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which understanding Miss Andrews and I continued our
walk, and when we parted I found that the little <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>interview I
had started to write had turned into the suggestion of a romance,
which I was in duty bound to destroy&mdash;but I began to have a
glimmering of an idea as to who the man was that Marguerite
Andrews wished for a hero, and I regretted also to find myself
convinced of the truth of her statement that that man did not
bear my name.</p>
<h2><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

HARLEY RETURNS TO THE FRAY</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>I will be master of what is mine
own</i>:<br />
<i>She is my goods</i>, <i>my chattels</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;&ldquo;Taming of the
Shrew.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of ten days Harley
returned from Barnegat, brown as a berry and ready for war, if
war it was still to be.&nbsp; The outing had done him a world of
good, and the fish stories he told as we sat at dinner showed
that, realist though he might be, he had yet not failed to
cultivate his imagination in certain directions.&nbsp; I may
observe in passing, and in this connection, that if I had a son
whom it was my ambition to see making <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>his mark in the world as a writer of
romance, as distinguished from the real, I should, as the first
step in his development, take care that he became a
fisherman.&nbsp; The telling of tales of the fish he caught when
no one else was near to see would give him, as it has given many
another, a good schooling in the realms of the imagination.</p>
<p>I was glad to note that Harley&rsquo;s wonted cheerfulness had
returned, and that he had become more like himself than he had
been at any time since his first failure with Miss Andrews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your advice was excellent,&rdquo; he said, as we sipped
our coffee at the club the night of his return.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have a clear two weeks in which to tackle that story, and I feel
confident now that I shall get it done.&nbsp; Furthermore, I
shall send the <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>chapters to Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick as I write
them, so that there must be no failure.&nbsp; I shall be
compelled to finish the tale, whatever may happen, and Miss
Andrews shall go through to the bitter end,
willy-nilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rash, Harley,&rdquo; I said; for it
seemed to me that Miss Andrews, having consented at my
solicitation to be a docile heroine for just so long as Harley
did not insist upon her marrying the man she did not love, it was
no time for him to break away from the principles he had so
steadfastly adhered to hitherto and become a martinet.&nbsp; He
struck me as being more than likely to crack the whip like a
ring-master in his present mood than to play the indulgent
author, and I felt pretty confident that <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>the instant
the snap of the lash reached the ears of Marguerite Andrews his
troubles would begin again tenfold, both in quality and in
quantity, with no possible hope for a future reconciliation
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be rash,&rdquo; said
Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never was rash, and I&rsquo;m not going to
begin now, but I shall use my nerve.&nbsp; That has been the
trouble with me in the past.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t been
firm.&nbsp; I have let that girl have her own way in everything,
and I&rsquo;m very much afraid I have spoiled her.&nbsp; She
behaves like a child with indulgent parents.&nbsp; In the last
instance, the Parker proposal, she simply ran her independence
into the ground.&nbsp; She was not only rebellious to me, but she
was impertinent to him.&nbsp; Her attitude toward him was not
nature <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>at all; it was not realism, because she is a woman of
good breeding, and would naturally be the last to treat any man,
distasteful or not, with such excessive rudeness.&nbsp; I
compelled him to go on and propose to her, though after he had
been at it for five minutes I could see that he wished he was
well out of it.&nbsp; I should have taken her in hand and
controlled her with equal firmness, declining to permit her to
speak so openly.&nbsp; Frankness is good enough, especially in
women, among whom you rarely find it; but frankness of the sort
she indulged in has no place in the polite circle in which she
moves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, she spoke that way&mdash;you said
yourself she did,&rdquo; I said, seeing that he was wrathful with
Marguerite, and wishing to assuage his anger before <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>it carried
him to lengths he might regret.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got
to take her as she is or drop her altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did&mdash;I repeat that she did speak that way, but
that was no reason why I should submit to it,&rdquo; Harley
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the fault of her mood.&nbsp; She
was nervous, almost hysterical&mdash;<a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>thanks to her rebellious
spirit.&nbsp; The moment I discovered how things were going I
should have gone back and started afresh, and kept on doing so
until I had her submissive.&nbsp; A hunter may balk at a high
fence, but the rider must not give in to him unless he wishes to
let the animal get the better of him.&nbsp; If he is wise he will
go back and put the horse to it again and again, until he finally
clears the topmost bar.&nbsp; That I should have done in this
instance, and that I <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>now intend to do, until that book
comes out as I want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to laugh in my sleeve.&nbsp; On the whole, Harley was
very like most other realists, who pretend that they merely put
down life as it is, and who go through their professional careers
serenely unconscious of the truth that their fancies, after all,
serve them when their facts are lacking.&nbsp; Even that most
eminent disciple of the Realistic Cult, Mr. Darrow, has been
known to kill off a hero in a railroad accident that owed its
being to nothing short of his own imagination, in order that the
unhappy wight might not offend the readers of the highly moral
magazine, in which the story first appeared, by marrying a widow
whom he had been forced by Mr. Darrow to love before her husband
died.&nbsp; Mr. <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Darrow manufactured, with five strokes of his pen, an
engine and a tunnel to crush the life out of the poor fellow,
whom an immoral romancer would have allowed to live on and marry
the lady, and with perfect propriety too, since the hero and the
heroine were both of them the very models of virtue, in spite of
the love which they did not seek, and which Mr. Darrow
deliberately and almost brutally thrust into their otherwise
happy lives.&nbsp; Of course the railway accident was needed to
give the climax to the story, which without it might have run
through six more numbers of the magazine, to the exclusion of
more exciting material; but that will not relieve Mr.
Darrow&rsquo;s soul of the stain he has put upon it by deserting
Dame Realism for a moment to flirt with <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Romance,
when it comes to the Judgment Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I want it to be, so must it be,&rdquo; quoth
Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; thought I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will no doubt
be excellent; but be honest, and don&rsquo;t insist that
you&rsquo;ve taken down life as it is; for you may have an
astigmatism, for all you know, and life may not be at all what it
has seemed to you while you were putting it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Harley, leaning back in his chair
and drawing a long breath, which showed his determination,
&ldquo;to the bitter end she shall go, through such complications
as I choose to have her, encountering whatever villains I may
happen to find most convenient, and to complete her story she
shall marry the man I select for my hero, if he is as <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>commonplace
as the average salesman in a Brooklyn universal dry-goods
emporium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine my feelings if you can!&nbsp; Having gone as a
self-appointed ambassador to the enemy to secure terms of peace,
to return to find my principal donning his armor and daubing his
face with paint for a renewal of the combat, was certainly not
pleasant.&nbsp; What could I say to Marguerite Andrews if I ever
met her in real life?&nbsp; How could I look her in the
eye?&nbsp; The situation overpowered me, and I hardly knew what
to say.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t beg Harley to stick to his realism
and not indulge in compulsion, because I had often jeered at him
for not infusing a little more of the dramatic into his stories,
even if it had to be &ldquo;lugged in by the ears,&rdquo; as he
put <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>it.&nbsp; Nor was he in any mood for me to tell him of
my breach of faith&mdash;the mere knowledge that she had promised
to be docile out of charity would have stung his pride, and I
thought it would be better, for the time, at least, to let my
interview remain a secret.&nbsp; Fortune favored me,
however.&nbsp; Kelly and the Professor entered the dining room at
this moment, and the Professor held in his hand a copy of the
current issue of The Literary Man, Messrs. Herring, Beemer, &amp;
Chadwick&rsquo;s fortnightly publication, a periodical having to
do wholly with things bookish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sat for this, Stuart?&rdquo; called out the
Professor, tapping the frontispiece of the magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sat for what?&rdquo; replied Stuart, looking
up.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>&ldquo;This picture,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a picture of a finely intellectual-looking
person with your name under it, Harley,&rdquo; put in the
Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;that,&rdquo; said Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;It does
flatter me a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So does the article with it,&rdquo; said Kelly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Says you are a great man&mdash;man with an idea, and all
that.&nbsp; Is that true, or is it just plain libel?&nbsp; Have
you an idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley laughed good-naturedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had one once,
but it&rsquo;s lost,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to that
picture, they&rsquo;re bringing out a book for me,&rdquo; he
added, modestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good ad., you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are through with that, Professor,&rdquo; I put
in, &ldquo;let me have it, will you?&nbsp; I want to see what it
says about Harley.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a first-rate screed,&rdquo; replied
the Professor, handing over the publication.&nbsp; &ldquo;It hits
Harley right on the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as that&rsquo;s pleasant,&rdquo;
said Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean, my dear boy,&rdquo; said the Professor,
&ldquo;is that it does you justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it really did do Harley justice, although, as he had
suggested, it was written largely to advertise the forthcoming
work.&nbsp; It spoke nicely of Harley&rsquo;s previous efforts,
and judiciously, as it seemed to me.&nbsp; He had not got to the
top of the ladder yet, but he was getting there by a slow, steady
development, and largely because he was a man with a fixed idea
as to what literature ought to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harley has seen clearly from <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the outset
what it was that he wished to accomplish and how to accomplish
it,&rdquo; the writer observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has swerved
neither to the right nor to the left, but has progressed
undeviatingly along the lines he has mapped out for himself, and
keeping constantly in mind the principles which seemed to him at
the beginning of his career to be right.&nbsp; It has been this
persistent and consistent adherence to principle that has gained
for Mr. Harley his hearing, and which is constantly rendering
more certain and permanent his position in the world
literary.&nbsp; Others may be led hither and yon by the fads and
follies of the scatter-brained, but Realism will ever have one
steadfast champion in Stuart Harley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; I said, tossing the journal across
the table.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>He
read it, and blushed to the roots of his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time to desert the flag, Harley,&rdquo; said
I, as he read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stick to your colors, and let her
stick to hers.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better be careful how you force
your heroine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should think
so, and for more reasons than one.&nbsp; I never really intended
to do horrible things with her, my boy.&nbsp; Trust me, if I do
lead her, to lead her gently.&nbsp; My persuasion will be
suggestive rather than mandatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that hero&mdash;from the Brooklyn dry-goods
shop?&rdquo; I asked, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him so much as&mdash;tell her the
price of anything,&rdquo; cried Harley.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man like
that has no business to live in the same hemisphere with a <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>woman like
Marguerite Andrews.&nbsp; When I threatened her with him I was
conversing through a large and elegant though wholly invisible
hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I breathed more freely.&nbsp; She was still sacred and safe in
his hands.&nbsp; Shortly after, dinner over, we left the table,
and went to the theatre, where we saw what the programme called
the &ldquo;latest London realistic success,&rdquo; in which three
of the four acts of an intensely exciting melodrama depended upon
a woman&rsquo;s not seeing a large navy revolver, which lay on
the table directly before her eyes in the first.&nbsp; The play
was full of blood and replete with thunder, and we truly enjoyed
it, only Harley would not talk much between the acts.&nbsp; He
was unusually moody.&nbsp; After the play was over his tongue
loosened, however, and we went <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>to the Players for a supper, and
there he burst forth into speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Marguerite Andrews had been the heroine of that play
she&rsquo;d have seen that gun, and the audience would have had
to go home inside of ten minutes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Later on
he burst out with, &ldquo;If my Miss Andrews had been the heroine
of that play, the man who falls over the precipice in the second
act would have been alive at this moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
finally he demanded: &ldquo;Do you suppose a heroine like
Marguerite Andrews would have overlooked the comma on the postal
card that woman read in the third act, and so made the fourth act
possible?&nbsp; Not she.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a woman with a
mind.&nbsp; And yet they call that the latest London realistic
success!&nbsp; Realistic!&nbsp; These Londoners do not <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>seem to
understand their own language.&nbsp; If that play was realism,
what sort of a nightmare do you suppose a romantic drama would
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe London women in real life haven&rsquo;t any
minds,&rdquo; I said, growing rather weary of the subject.&nbsp;
I admired Miss Andrews myself, but there were other things I
could talk about&mdash;&ldquo;like lemonade and elephants,&rdquo;
as the small boy said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let it go at that.&nbsp; It
was an interesting play, and that&rsquo;s all plays ought to
be.&nbsp; Realism in plays is not to be encouraged.&nbsp; A man
goes to the theatre to be amused and entertained, not to be
reminded of home discomforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stuart looked at me reproachfully, ordered a fresh cigar, and
suggested turning in for the night.&nbsp; I walked home <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>with him
and tried to get him interested in a farce I was at work on, but
it was of no use.&nbsp; He had become a monomaniac, and his
monomania was his rebellious heroine.&nbsp; Finally I blurted
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Stuart, get the woman
caged, will you?&nbsp; For, candidly, I&rsquo;d like to talk
about something else, and until Marguerite Andrews is disposed of
I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll be able to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have half the work done by this time
to-morrow night,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got ten
thousand words of it in my mind now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you there are only two words down in
your mind,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marguerite and Andrews,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>Stuart laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the only
ones I&rsquo;m sure of,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And then we
parted.</p>
<p>But he was right about what he would have accomplished by that
time the next night; for before sundown he had half the story
written, and, what is more, the chapters had come as easily as
any writing he ever did.&nbsp; For docility, Marguerite was a
perfect wonder.&nbsp; Not only did she follow out his wishes; she
often anticipated them, and in certain parts gave him a lead in a
new direction, which, Stuart said, gave the story a hundred per
cent. more character.</p>
<p>In short, Marguerite Andrews was keeping her promise to me
nobly.&nbsp; The only thing I regretted about it, now that all
seemed plain sailing, was its <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>effect on Stuart.&nbsp; Her
amiability was proving a great attraction to his susceptible
soul, and I was beginning to fear that Stuart was slowly but
surely falling in love with his rebellious heroine, which would
never do, unless she were really real, on which point I was most
uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a terrible thing,&rdquo; said I
confidentially to myself, &ldquo;if Stuart Harley were to fall in
love with a creation of his own realism.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> events just narrated took place
on the 15th of August, and as Harley&rsquo;s time to fulfil his
contract with Messrs. Herring, Beemer, &amp; Chadwick was growing
very short&mdash;two weeks is short shrift for an author with a
book to write for waiting presses, even with a willing and
helpful cast of characters&mdash;so I resolved not to intrude
upon him until he himself should summon me.&nbsp; I knew myself,
from bitter experience, how unwelcome <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the most welcome of one&rsquo;s
friends can be at busy hours, having had many a beautiful sketch
absolutely ruined by the untimely intrusion of those who wished
me well, so I resolutely kept myself away from his den, although
I was burning with curiosity to know how he was getting on.</p>
<p>On occasions my curiosity would get the better of my judgment,
and I would endeavor, with the aid of my own muses, to hold a
moment&rsquo;s chat with Miss Andrews; but she eluded me.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t find her at all&mdash;as, indeed, how should I,
since Harley had not taken me into his confidence as to his
intentions in the new story?&nbsp; He might have laid the scene
of it in Singapore, for aught I knew, and, wander where I would
in my fancy, I was utterly unable to discover <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>her
whereabouts, until one evening a very weird thing
happened&mdash;a thing so weird that I have been pinching myself
with great assiduity ever since in order to reassure myself of my
own existence.&nbsp; I had come home from a hard day&rsquo;s
editorial work, had dined alone and comfortably, and was
stretched out at full length upon the low divan that stands at
the end of my workshop&mdash;the delight of my weary bones and
the envy of my friends, who have never been able to find anywhere
another exactly like it.&nbsp; My cigar was between my lips, and
above my head, rising in a curling cloud to the ceiling, was a
mass of smoke.&nbsp; I am sure I was not dreaming, although how
else to account for it I do not know.&nbsp; What happened, to put
it briefly, was my sudden transportation <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>to a little
mountain hotel not far from Lake George, where I found myself
sitting and talking to the woman I had so futilely sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said she, pleasantly, as I
materialized at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as well as a person can be,&rdquo; I replied,
rubbing my eyes in confusion, &ldquo;who suddenly finds himself
two hundred and fifty miles away from the spot where, a half-hour
before, he had lain down to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Andrews laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see how it is
yourself,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how what is myself?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be the puppet of a person who&mdash;writes,&rdquo;
she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have I become that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; she smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>The
idea made me nervous, and I pinched my arm to see whether I was
there or not.&nbsp; The result was not altogether
reassuring.&nbsp; I never felt the pinch, and, try as I would, I
couldn&rsquo;t make myself feel it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for deviating a moment
from the matter in hand, but have you a hat-pin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but I have a brooch, if
that will serve your purpose.&nbsp; What do you want it
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to run it into my arm for a moment,&rdquo; I
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t help you any,&rdquo; she answered,
smiling divinely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have a word with you; all
the hat-pins in the world shall not prevent me, now that you are
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wait a minute, I beg of you,&rdquo; <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>I
implored.&nbsp; &ldquo;You intimated a moment ago that I was a
puppet in the hands of some author.&nbsp; Whose?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
a reputation to sustain, and shall not give myself up willingly,
unless I am sure that that person will not trifle with my
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly my position,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I
said, you can now understand how it is yourself.&nbsp; But I will
tell you in whose hands you are now&mdash;you are in mine.&nbsp;
Surely if you had the right to send me tearing down Bellevue
Avenue at Newport behind a runaway horse, and then pursue me in
spirit to the Profile House, I have the right to bring you here,
and I have accordingly done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a woman&rsquo;s, her logic was surprisingly
convincing.&nbsp; She certainly had as much right to trifle with
my comfort as I had to trifle with hers.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;You are right, Miss Andrews,&rdquo; I murmured,
meekly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray command me as you will&mdash;and deal
gently with the erring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will treat you far better than you treated me,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;So have no fear&mdash;although I have been
half minded at times to revenge myself upon you for that
runaway.&nbsp; I could make you dreadfully uncomfortable, for
when I take my pen in hand my imagination in the direction of the
horrible is something awful.&nbsp; I shall be merciful, however,
for I believe in the realistic idea, and I will merely make use
of the power my pen possesses over you to have you act precisely
as you would if you were actually here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am not here?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she asked, archly.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>I was
about to say that if I weren&rsquo;t, I wished most heartily that
I were; but I remembered fortunately that it would never do for
me to flirt with Stuart Harley&rsquo;s heroine, so I contented
myself with saying, boldly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Andrews looked at me for a moment, and then, reaching out
her hand, took mine, pressed it, and relinquished it, saying,
&ldquo;You are a loyal friend indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing flirtatious about the act; it was a simple
and highly pleasing acknowledgment of my forbearance, and it made
me somewhat more comfortable than I had been at any time since my
sudden transportation through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember what I said to you?&rdquo; <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>she
resumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That I would cease to rebel, whatsoever Mr.
Harley asked me to do, unless he insisted upon marrying me to a
man I did not love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, as far as I
am aware, you have stuck by your agreement.&nbsp; Stuart, I doubt
not, has by this time got ready for his
finishing-touches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your surmise is correct,&rdquo; she answered, sadly;
and then, with some spirit, she added: &ldquo;And they are
finishing-touches with a vengeance.&nbsp; I have been loyal to my
word, in spite of much discomfort.&nbsp; I have travelled from
pillar to post as meekly as a lamb, because it fitted in with
Stuart Harley&rsquo;s convenience that I should do so.&nbsp; He
has taken me and my friend Mrs. Willard to and through five
different summer resorts, where I have cut the figure he wished
<a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>me to
cut without regard to my own feelings.&nbsp; I have discussed all
sorts of topics, of which in reality I know nothing, to lend
depth to his book.&nbsp; I have snubbed men I really liked, and
appeared to like men I profoundly hated, for his sake.&nbsp; I
have wittingly endured peril for his sake, knowing of course that
ultimately he would get me out of danger; but peril is peril just
the same, and to that extent distracting to the nerves.&nbsp; I
have been upset in a canoe at Bar Harbor, and lost on a mountain
in Vermont.&nbsp; I have sprained my ankle at Saratoga, and
fainted at a dance at Lenox; but no complaint have I
uttered&mdash;not even the suggestion of a rebellion have I
given.&nbsp; Once, I admit, I was disposed to resent his desire
that I should wear a certain costume, which he, man as he is,
could <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>not see would be wofully unbecoming.&nbsp; Authors have
no business to touch on such things.&nbsp; But I overcame the
temptation to rebel, and to please him wore a blue and pink
shirt-waist with a floral silk skirt at a garden-party&mdash;I
suppose he thought floral silk was appropriate to the garden; nor
did I even show my mortification to those about me.&nbsp; Nothing
was said in the book about its being Stuart Harley&rsquo;s taste;
it must needs be set down as mine; and while the pages of
Harley&rsquo;s book contain no criticism of my costume, I know
well enough what all the other women thought about it.&nbsp;
Still, I stood it.&nbsp; I endured also without a murmur the
courtship and declaration of love of a perfect booby of a man;
that is to say, he was a booby in the eyes of a woman&mdash;men
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>might
like him.&nbsp; I presume that as Mr. Harley has chosen him to
stand for the hero of his book, he must admire him; but I
don&rsquo;t, and haven&rsquo;t, and sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Yet I have pretended to do so; and finally, when he proposed
marriage to me I meekly answered &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; weeping in
the bitterness of my spirit that my promise bound me to do so;
and Stuart Harley, noting those tears, calls them tears of
joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have accepted him,&rdquo; I said,
softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t part of the
bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; she returned, positively;
&ldquo;that is, I regarded it so, and I must act according to my
views of things.&nbsp; What I promised was to follow his wishes
in all things save in marriage to a man I didn&rsquo;t
love.&nbsp; Getting engaged <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>is not getting married, and as he
wished me to get engaged, so I did, expecting of course that the
book would end there, as it ought to have done, and that
therefore no marriage would ever come of the
engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly the book should end there, then,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have kept to the letter of your agreement,
and nobly,&rdquo; I added, with enthusiasm, for I now saw what
the poor girl must have suffered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Harley
didn&rsquo;t try to go further, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; she said, her voice trembling with
emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;He set the time and place for the wedding,
issued the cards, provided me with a trousseau&mdash;a trousseau
based upon his intuitions of what a trousseau ought to be, and
therefore about as satisfactory to a woman <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of taste as
that floral silk costume of the garden-party; he engaged the
organist, chose my bridesmaids&mdash;girls I detested&mdash;and
finally assembled the guests.&nbsp; The groom was there at the
chancel rail; Mr. Willard, whom he had selected to give me away,
was waiting outside in the lobby, clad in his frock-coat, a
flower in his button-hole, and his arm ready for the bride to
lean on; the minister was behind the rail; the wedding-march was
sounding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; I cried, utterly unable to contain
myself longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was speeding past Yonkers on the three-o&rsquo;clock
Saratoga express&mdash;bound hither,&rdquo; she answered, with a
significant toss of her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one but yourself
knows where I am, and I have summoned you to explain my action
before <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>you hear of it from him.&nbsp; I do not wish to be
misjudged.&nbsp; Stuart Harley had his warning, but he chose to
ignore it, and he can get out of the difficulty he has brought
upon himself in his own way&mdash;possibly he will destroy the
whole book; but I wanted you to know that while he did not keep
the faith, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suddenly realized the appalling truth.&nbsp; My own weakness
was responsible for it all.&nbsp; I had not told Harley of my
interview and her promise, feeling that it was not necessary, and
fearing its effect upon his pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may add,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;that I am
bitterly disappointed in your friend.&nbsp; I was interested in
him, and believed in him.&nbsp; Most of my acts of
rebellion&mdash;if you can call me rebellious&mdash;were prompted
by my desire to keep <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>him true to his creed; and I will
tell you what I have never told to another: I regarded Stuart
Harley almost as an ideal man, but this has changed it all.&nbsp;
If he was what I thought him, he could not have acted with so
little conscience as to try to force this match upon me, when he
must have known that I did not love Henry Dunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should have been sure before providing for the
ceremony, after hearing what I had promised you I would and would
not do,&rdquo; said Marguerite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I never told him anything about your
promise!&rdquo; I shouted, desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has done
all this unwittingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you tell him?&rdquo;
she cried, eagerly grasping my hand.&nbsp; <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>Her manner
left no doubt in my mind as to who the hero of her choice would
be&mdash;and again I sighed to think that it was not I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As true as that I stand here,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know what I mean!&rdquo; I said,
excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherever I do stand, it&rsquo;s as true
as that I stand there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase was awkward, but it fulfilled its purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t think it necessary.&nbsp; Fact
is,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I had a sort of notion that if you
married anybody in one of Harley&rsquo;s books, if Harley had his
own way it would be to the man who&mdash;who tells the
sto&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>A
loud noise interrupted my remark and I started up in alarm, and
in an instant I found myself back in my rooms in town once
more.&nbsp; The little mountain house near Lake George, with its
interesting and beautiful guest, had faded from sight, and I
realized that somebody was hammering with a stick upon my
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I&mdash;Harley,&rdquo; came Stuart&rsquo;s
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I unlocked the door and he entered.&nbsp; The brown of
Barnegat had gone, and he was his broken self again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, trying to ignore his appearance,
which really shocked me, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s the book?&nbsp; Got
it done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank into a chair with a groan.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;Hang the book!&mdash;it&rsquo;s all up with
that; I&rsquo;m going to Chadwick to-morrow and call the thing
off,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t work&mdash;two
weeks&rsquo; steady application gone for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;not as bad as
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely as bad as that,&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What can a fellow do if his heroine disappears as
completely as if the earth had opened and swallowed her
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; I cried, with difficulty repressing my
desire to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Completely&mdash;searched high and low for her&mdash;no
earthly use,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even
imagine where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which, my dear Stuart,&rdquo; I said, adopting a
superior tone for the moment, &ldquo;shows that an imagination
that is worth something wouldn&rsquo;t be a <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>bad
possession for a realist, after all.&nbsp; I know where your
heroine is.&nbsp; She is at a little mountain house near Lake
George, and she has fled there to escape your booby of a hero,
whom you should have known better than to force upon a girl like
Marguerite Andrews.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re getting inartistic, my
dear boy.&nbsp; Sacrifice something to the American girl, but
don&rsquo;t sacrifice your art.&nbsp; Just because the aforesaid
girl likes her stories to end up with a wedding is no reason why
you should try to condemn your heroine to life-long
misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stuart looked at me with a puzzled expression for a full
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the deuce do you know anything about it?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>I immediately enlightened him.&nbsp; I told him every
circumstance&mdash;even my <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>suspicion as to the hero of her
heart, and it seemed to please him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the story go if you stop it with the
engagement?&rdquo; I asked, after it was all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
shall not publish it.&nbsp; If it was all so distasteful to her
as you say, I&rsquo;d rather destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Change
the heroine&rsquo;s name, and nobody but ourselves will ever be
the wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve no
imagination,&rdquo; I retorted.</p>
<p>Stuart smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea, and
I&rsquo;ll do it; it won&rsquo;t be the truest realism, but I
think I am entitled to the leeway on one lapse,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; I rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lapse for <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>the sake of
realism.&nbsp; The man who never lapses is not real.&nbsp; There
never was such a man.&nbsp; You might change that garden-party
costume too.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t think of a better
combination than that, leave it to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write to
my sister and ask her to design a decent dress for that
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Stuart, with a laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I accept your offer; but, I say, what was the name of the
little mountain house where you found her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
made such an infernal row battering down my door that I came away
in a hurry and forgot to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is unfortunate,&rdquo; said Stuart.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should have liked to go up there for a while&mdash;she might help
me correct the proofs, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>That&rsquo;s what he said, but he didn&rsquo;t deceive
me.&nbsp; He loved her, and I began again to hope to gracious
that Harley had not deceived himself and me, and that Marguerite
Andrews was a bit of real life, and not a work of the
imagination.</p>
<p>At any rate, Harley had an abiding faith in her existence, for
the following Monday night he packed his case and set out for
Lake George.&nbsp; He was going to explore, he said.</p>
<h2><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>X<br
/>
BY WAY OF EPILOGUE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Let</i>, <i>down the curtain</i>, <i>the
farce is done</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rabelais</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">suppose</span> my story ought to end
here, since Harley&rsquo;s rebellious heroine has finally been
subdued for the use of his publishers and the consequent
declaration of dividends for the Harley exchequer; but there was
an epilogue to the little farce, which nearly turned it into
tragedy, from which the principals were saved by nothing short of
my own ingenuity.&nbsp; Harley had fallen desperately in love
with Marguerite Andrews, <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>and Marguerite Andrews had fallen in
love with Stuart Harley, and Harley couldn&rsquo;t find
her.&nbsp; She eluded his every effort, and he began to doubt
that he had drawn her from real life, after all.&nbsp; She had
become a Marjorie Daw to him, and the notion that he must go
through life cherishing a hopeless passion was distracting to
him.&nbsp; His book was the greatest of his successes, which was
an additional cause of discomfort to him, since, knowing as he
now did that his study was not a faithful portrayal of the inner
life of his heroine, he felt that the laurels that were being
placed upon his brow had been obtained under false pretences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like a hypocrite,&rdquo; he said, as he read an
enthusiastic review of his little work from the pen of no less a
person <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>than Mr. Darrow, the high-priest of the realistic
sect.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid I shall not be able to look Darrow
in the eye when I meet him at the club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear for that, Stuart,&rdquo; I said, laughing
inwardly at his plight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brazen it out; keep a stiff
upper lip, and Darrow will never know.&nbsp; He has insight, of
course, but he can&rsquo;t see as far in as you and he
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a devilish situation,&rdquo; he cried,
impatiently striding up and down the room, &ldquo;that a man of
my age should be so hopelessly in love with a woman he
can&rsquo;t find; and that he can&rsquo;t find her is such a
cruel sarcasm upon his literary creed!&nbsp; What cursed
idiosyncrasy of fate is it that has brought this thing upon
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the punishment that fits your <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>crime,
Harley,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been rather
narrow minded in your literary ideas.&nbsp; Possibly it will make
a more tolerant critic of you hereafter, when you come to flay
fellows like Balderstone for venturing to think differently from
you as to the sort of books it is proper to write.&nbsp; He has
as much right to the profits he can derive from his fancy as you
have to the emoluments of your insight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take some comfort if I thought that she
really loved me,&rdquo; he said, mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no doubt on that score, Stuart,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She does love you.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; I
wish she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why can&rsquo;t I find her?&nbsp; Why does she
hide from me?&rdquo; he cried, fortunately ignoring my devoutly
expressed <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>wish, which slipped out before I knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she is a woman,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t your analytical mind told you yet that the
more a woman loves a man, the harder he&rsquo;s got to work to
find it out and&mdash;and clinch the bargain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are right,&rdquo; he said,
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if I were a woman, and knew I was
killing a man by keeping myself in hiding, I&rsquo;d come out and
show myself at any cost, especially if I loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are dealing in imagination, Harley,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;and that never was your strong point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was right on one point.&nbsp; The
hopelessness of his quest was killing Harley&mdash;not physically
exactly, but emotionally, as it were.&nbsp; It <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>was taking
all the heart out of him, and his present state of mind was far
more deplorable than when he was struggling with the book, and
constantly growing worse.&nbsp; He tried every device to find
her&mdash;the Willards were conjured up, and knew nothing; Mrs.
Corwin and the twins were brought back from Europe, and refused
to yield up the secret; all the powers of a realistic pen were
brought to bear upon her, and yet she refused utterly to
materialize.</p>
<p>Finally, I found it necessary to act myself.&nbsp; I could not
stand the sight of Harley being gradually eaten up by the longing
of his own soul, and I tried my hand at exploration.&nbsp; I had
no better success for several weeks; and then, like an
inspiration, the whole thing came to <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>me.&nbsp; &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t
come when he summons her, because she loves him.&nbsp; She
won&rsquo;t summon him to come to her, for the same reason.&nbsp;
Why not summon both of them yourself to a common ground?&nbsp;
Embalm them in a little romance of your own.&nbsp; Force them if
need be, but get them there, and so bring them together, and let
them work out their own happiness,&rdquo; said I to myself.&nbsp;
The only difficulty that presented itself was as to whether or
not Marguerite would allow herself to be forced.&nbsp; It was
worth the trial, however, and fortune favored me.&nbsp; I found
her far from rebellious.&nbsp; My pen had hardly touched paper
when she materialized, more bewilderingly beautiful than
ever.&nbsp; I laid the scene of my little essay at Lake-wood, and
I found her sitting down by <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>the water, dreamily gazing out over
the lake.&nbsp; In her lap was Stuart Harley&rsquo;s book, and
daintily pasted on the fly-leaf of this was the portrait which
had appeared in the August issue of <i>The Literary Man</i>,
which she had cut out and preserved.</p>
<p>Having provided the heroine with a spot conducive to her
comfort, I hastened to transport Harley to the scene.&nbsp; It
was easy to do, seeing how deeply interested I was in my plot and
how willing he was.&nbsp; I got him there looking like a Greek
god, only a trifle more interesting, because of his
sympathy-arousing pallor&mdash;the pallor which comes from an
undeserved buffeting at the hands of a mischievous Cupid.&nbsp; I
know it well, for I have observed it several times upon my own
countenance.&nbsp; The <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>moment Harley appeared upon the
scene I chose to have Marguerite hastily clasp the book in her
hands, raise it to her lips, and kiss the picture&mdash;and it
must have been intensely true to life, for she did it without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, almost anticipating my convenience,
throwing an amount of passion into the act which made my pen
fairly hiss as I dipped it into the ink.&nbsp; Of course Harley
could not fail to see it&mdash;I had taken care to arrange all
that&mdash;and equally of course he could not fail to comprehend
what that kiss meant; could not fail to stop short, with a
convulsive effort to control himself&mdash;heroes always do that;
could not fail thereby to attract her attention.&nbsp; After this
nothing was more natural than that she should spring to her feet,
&ldquo;the blushes of a <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>surprised love mantling her
cheeks&rdquo;; it was equally natural that she should try to run,
should slip, have him catch her arm and save her from falling,
and&mdash;well, I am not going to tell the whole story.&nbsp; I
have neither the time, the inclination, nor the talent to lay
bare to the world the love-affairs of my friend.&nbsp;
Furthermore, having got them together, I discreetly withdrew, so
that even if I were to try to write up the rest of the courtship,
it would merely result in my telling you how I imagined it
progressed, and I fancy my readers are as well up in matters of
that sort as I am.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, therefore, that in
this way I brought Stuart Harley and Marguerite Andrews together,
and that the event justified the means: and that the other day,
when Mr. and <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>Mrs. Harley returned from their honeymoon, they told me
they thought I ought to give up humor and take to writing
love-stories.</p>

<img alt=

"I am not going to tell the whole story"
src="images/p222s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That kissing the picture episode,&rdquo; said Stuart,
looking gratefully at me, &ldquo;was an inspiration.&nbsp; To my
mind, it was the most satisfactory thing you&rsquo;ve ever
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that!&rdquo; cried his wife, with a mischievous
twinkle in her eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; It
was I who kissed the picture.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t have made
me do anything else to save his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebellious to the last!&rdquo; said I, with a sigh to
think that I must now write the word &ldquo;Finis&rdquo; to my
little farce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rebellious to
the last.&nbsp; I shall never consent to be the heroine of a book
again, until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>She
paused and looked at Stuart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until what?&rdquo; he asked, tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until you write your autobiography,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have always wanted of be the heroine of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And throwing down my pen, I discovered I was alone.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
